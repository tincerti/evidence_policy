This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Trickle Up Plus program; other factors are likely to have contributed.","Absence of conflict of interest.","Trickle Up is a nonprofit agency that has been working in Burkina Faso, West Africa, for more than 10 years. Women participating in the Trickle Up Plus program received: 1) access to a newly formed women's savings group; 2) training in livelihood planning and household management for women in the savings group; 3) the equivalent of $100 to start or expand livelihood activities; 4) one-on-one mentoring offered by trained field workers; and 5) family coaching to increase awareness about hazardous child work, labor-related child separation, and early/forced marriage. These coaching components were developed by the Burkina Faso Ministry of Social Action and implemented by a community-based organization Aide au Enfants et aux Families Démunies. Coaches received three days of training from the Ministry of Social Action. Families received monthly sessions, each lasting 35 to 45 minutes (the authors do not indicate how many months of coaching were provided). Women were enrolled in the program for 24 months.
Trickle Up implemented the program, which targeted females in poor households in the Nord Region of Burkina Faso that cared for a child 10 to 15 years old. The authors did not provide information about how often the savings group met, how training was provided, or how often one-on-one mentoring was provided.","The study was a randomized controlled trial at the village level. Study participants were selected in three stages. First, 12 villages in the Nord Region were selected. Researchers selected the villages based on comparability of population, size, ethnic makeup, distance from an urban center, and socioeconomic status, although all residents in the area were considered extremely poor. Villages were then randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups; four were assigned to Trickle Up, four were assigned to Trickle Up Plus, and four were assigned to the control group. Second, 30 of the poorest households were selected in each village based on the Participatory Wealth Ranking developed by Trickle Up. This resulted in 120 households in each group. In the last stage, a female that cared for a child 10 to 15 years of age, and one child (aged 10 to 15 years old), were enrolled in the study. After these three stages of selection, 120 females and 120 children were in each group, resulting in a total sample of 720 people. Households in the control condition did not receive anything; however, they were placed on a waiting list and were to receive the intervention in 2017 after the study ended. Data were obtained from surveys conducted at baseline before the program started, 12 months after the intervention started, and 24 months after the intervention started (at program end). The authors used statistical models to compare the outcomes of treatment and control group members.","Employment/Child labor
After 24 months of participating in the Trickle Up Plus program, children were significantly less likely to have used machinery or heavy equipment that could lead to a serious injury (40% less likely than children in the control group), significantly less likely to have been exposed to dust fumes, insufficient ventilation, chemicals, or explosives (30% less likely); and significantly less likely to have been shouted at or repeatedly insulted (10% less likely).
After 24 months of participating in the Trickle Up Plus program, children were significantly less likely to have experienced any hazardous working conditions or abuse while collecting water (30% less likely), collecting wood (30% less likely), cooking (40% less likely), cleaning dishes or the house (50% less likely), or washing clothes (40% less likely).

This study was a randomized controlled trial that took place in the state of Nevada and involved new UI claimants from July to December 2009. The authors used program administrative and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax return data to compare outcomes of participants with outcomes of the control group for six years following the intervention.
The study found that participants of the Nevada REA program experienced greater increases in employment and earnings relative to the control group for each of the six years following the intervention. Additionally, the study found that participants of the Nevada REA program experienced greater decreases in UI benefit receipt relative to the control group and lower benefit amounts in the first year after program entry.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Nevada REA program, and not to other factors.See more CLEAR profiles related to The Reemployment and Eligibility Assessment.","Absence of conflict of interest.","Since its inception in 2005, 40 states have implemented the REA initiative to encourage rapid reemployment of UI claimants through a combination of in-person eligibility reviews and employment-focused case management. In the Nevada version of REA, program participants were required to receive not only REA services but also reemployment services, which were provided by the same staff. REA services included an individual assessment, orientation to the One-Stop Career Center (now known as American Job Center), provision of labor market information, a workforce service workshop, and development of an individual reemployment plan. Reemployment services included job search and resume assistance, job matching against state and federal position databases, and provision of information regarding job training options.
To be eligible for the program, Nevada residents had to be filing first-time UI claims, have received at least one week of benefits under the new claim, have no scheduled return to a previous employer, not concurrently be participating in other training programs, have no exclusive union hiring hall agreements, and not be part of the Worker Profiling and Reemployment Services program.","This randomized controlled trial took place in the state of Nevada and involved Nevada residents filing first-time UI claims from July to December 2009 in two workforce regions of the state: the Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise and the Reno metropolitan areas. A total of 32,751 claimants were deemed eligible for the program; 4,673 were randomly assigned to the REA program and 28,078 to the control group. The probability of assignment to the REA program varied based on program capacity each week but was typically around 15 percent. Treatment group members received REA and reemployment services. Control group members were not required to receive REA or reemployment services but had to continue the usual requirements for UI claimants, such as filing weekly claims, conducting an independent job search, and being subject to random quality assurance evaluation. If desired, the control group members could seek out reemployment services on their own.
The authors used two data sets in their analyses: (1) administrative data maintained by the Nevada REA program that included information on program participation and private-sector quarterly earnings in Nevada from 2008 to 2011, and (2) tax records maintained by the IRS that included W-2 statements and filed tax returns from 2001 to 2015. The authors used a statistical model to compare the outcomes of treatment and control group members in terms of employment, earnings, and UI benefit receipt in each year.","Employment
• The Nevada REA program increased employment by 5.1 percentage points in the first full year after program entry and by 2.9 to 4.5 percentage points in the next five years after program entry (from 2011 to 2015). This result was statistically significant in each year.
Earnings
• The Nevada REA program increased earnings by $1,361 in the first full year after program entry and by $1,413 to $2,087 in the next five years after program entry (from 2011 to 2015). This result was statistically significant in each year.
UI benefit receipt
• The Nevada REA program significantly decreased UI benefit receipt and UI benefit amount collected in the first full year after program entry. The study did not find any impacts on UI benefits after the first year.","The authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to employment, earnings, and UI benefit receipt for each year they examined from 2010 to 2015. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.
In addition, the authors reported estimates of the effects of the Nevada REA program on UI benefit receipt and UI benefit amount collected graphically and did not provide specific numeric estimates.","",""

The study used a nonexperimental design to compare labor outcomes of children who received the conditional cash transfer with a matched comparison group of children who did not, based on data from a national household survey.
The study found that the program was significantly related to an increase in child labor, with a 52.5 percent increase in hours spent on child labor for those receiving Bolsa Familia.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not ensure that the groups being compared were similar before the intervention. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to Bolsa Familia; other factors are likely to have contributed.","Absence of Conflict of Interest.","Bolsa Familia was introduced as a government conditional cash transfer (CCT) program in Brazil in 2004. Bolsa Familia provides cash payments to families with high socioeconomic vulnerability conditional on school attendance for children aged 6-17. It also provides social assistance to children under 16 who have been removed from child labor. By the fall of 2013, there were over 16 million children in the program.","The authors used a nonexperimental design to compare the labor outcomes of children ages 6 to 17 who received the CCT with those who did not receive it, based on data from Brazil’s 2006 national household survey Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicilios (PNAD). Bolsa Familia program participation was identified through a survey item on PNAD. For the study, the sample was limited to households that had a member between the ages of 0 and 17 and whose income was less than $300 Reais ($139.53 USD) a month. The authors created a matched comparison group based on child characteristics (e.g., age), parent characteristics (e.g., maternal education), and household characteristics (e.g., number of children in the household). The analysis sample included 11,869 children in the treatment group and 5,250 children in the comparison group. In 2006, households that were receiving the program reported higher rates of school attendance (72 percent versus 58 percent), lower rates of child labor (87 percent versus 93 percent) and higher rates of living in rural areas (46 percent versus 25 percent) than those not receiving the program.","Employment/Child labor
The study found a statistically significant relationship between program participation and an increase in child labor, with a 52.5 percent increase in the hours allocated to labor among children whose families participated in Bolsa Familia.","The authors created a matched group of non-participating eligible children to compare to Bolsa Escola participating children. However, the authors did not fully account for preexisting differences between the groups before Bolsa Familia program participation as they did not match or control for gender or pre-intervention child labor. These preexisting differences between the groups—and not Bolsa Familia—could explain the observed differences in outcomes.","",""

The study was a randomized controlled trial. The researchers used household surveys, administered at baseline and two and half years after the intervention began, to assess program impact on schooling and child labor outcomes between the treatment and control groups.
The study found that, two and a half years after the program began, a significantly higher proportion of children participating in the program worked for pay outside of their household than children not participating in the program. However, there was a significantly greater proportion of children in the treatment group than the control group who attended school and attended school regularly. Similarly, children in the treatment group attended a significantly greater number of days of school than those in the control group.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the the Pantawid Pamilya Pilipino Program, and not to other factors.","Absence of conflict of interest.","The Pantawid Pamilya Pilipino Program (referred to as Pantawid), is a conditional cash transfer program operated in the Philippines, whose goals are to encourage households to support children’s health and to keep them in school rather than child labor activities. Participating households receive 300 Philippine Pesos ($7 USD) per month for each child (up to three children), aged 6-14, and attends school regularly. Households also receive 500 Philippine Pesos ($11 USD) each month if they meet certain health care conditions: that pregnant women and children 5 or younger visit health clinics, that children 6-14 get deworming treatment, and that the household member who received the payment, or their spouse, attends Family Development Sessions. To be eligible to participate, households needed to have a Proxy Means Test (PMT) score (an indicator of poverty) below the poverty level ($2.15 USD per person) and either have a child younger than 14 or a woman who was pregnant. The study was conducted by the World Bank and the Philippines Department of Social Welfare and Development.","The study was a randomized controlled trial in which the researchers randomly assigned 130 villages to create the treatment and control groups, with 65 villages in each group. The final sample included 637 children 10-14 years old in the treatment group and 627 in the control group. The control households did not receive any benefits. The outcome variables of school attendance and child labor were assessed using a survey administered to households 2.5 years after the intervention began. In the survey, school attendance questions were answered by a mother, guardian or caregiver, and child labor questions were answered by the child themselves. Regression analyses assessed the relationship between group assignment (treatment vs control) and each intervention outcome (child school attendance and child labor), focusing on children ages 10-14. These analyses controlled for location (municipality) and child age.","Employment/Child labor
After two and half years, a significantly higher proportion of children in the treatment group than in the control group worked for pay outside of their own household.
However, after two and a half years, there was not a significant difference in the proportion of children in the treatment group than in the control who group who did any work or worked for pay inside their own household.
There was also not a significant difference between the treatment and control group in the number of days worked for pay, or days worked inside or outside their own household.
Education (School participation/enrollment)
After two and a half years, there was a significantly greater proportion of children in the treatment group than the control group who attended school and attended school regularly.
In addition, after two and a half years, children in the treatment group had attended significantly more days of school in the past two weeks than children in the control group.
There were no significant differences between the treatment and control group in the proportion of children who attend primary school, secondary school, or who attend secondary school regularly. However, there was a significantly larger proportion of children in the treatment group than the control group who attend primary school regularly.","The authors note that the they did not have information on how consistently the requirements to receive the cash transfers were enforced. Differing enforcement practices could have affected the size of the program impact, for example, by not providing sufficient encouragement for households to keep children in school.","",""

The authors compared the employment rate, earnings, and college enrollment of the treatment group, youth who won a random lottery for the SYEP program and chose to participate in it, with those of the control group, youth who applied to the program but were not randomly selected to participate. The study used data from the Internal Revenue Service to measure outcomes over a five-year period.
The study found that, compared with earnings of the control group, the treatment group had significantly higher earnings in the year of participation in SYEP, but significantly lower earnings in the following three years. The treatment group also had a significantly higher probability of being employed in any job during the year of participation in SYEP and the first follow-up year compared with the employment probability of the control group.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the SYEP program, and not to other factors.","","The New York City Department of Youth and Community Development runs SYEP, which provides seven weeks of paid summer employment for youth 14 to 21 years old. It is the largest summer employment program in the United States and is available to all New York City youth who can provide the necessary documentation. Youth apply through a SYEP community-based organization provider, typically the one located closest to their home, and can only apply to one provider each year. Because more youth apply to the program than there are available summer jobs, SYEP uses a lottery to randomly select youth who will be offered the opportunity to participate in the program. Not all applicants selected by the lottery chose to participate in SYEP. In this case, SYEP continues to randomly select applicants until all the summer job placements fill up.","A random lottery determined eligibility for participation in the SYEP program. The authors assessed the impact of the SYEP intervention on earnings, employment, and college enrollment for those that participated in the program, compared with those of youth who were not randomly selected to participate in the program. The authors used winning the SYEP lottery to statistically identify program participants using an approach called instrumental variables estimation that preserves the random assignment. They accounted for the difference between providers and the number of applicants in each year in their analysis. In the authors’ analysis, the impact estimates can be interpreted as the effect of participation in SYEP rather than the effect of winning a SYEP lottery.
The authors collected SYEP administrative data from the Department of Youth and Community Development and Internal Revenue Service records for those who applied to SYEP in each of the years from 2005 to 2008. The study measured their outcomes during the year of the program plus four follow-up years. The sample included 164,641 youth in the treatment group and 129,459 in the control group. The average age of youth in the study was 16.5 years old, and just less than half of the sample was male. About half of the sample were African American youth, 27 percent were Latino, and 13 percent were white. For the study sample, the average household income in the year before the program was $39,526.","Employment. The study found that program participation significantly increased the likelihood of employment in any job (SYEP or otherwise) by 71 percentage points during the year of participation in SYEP and 1 percentage point in the following year, compared with that of those in the control group. There were no significant differences between the treatment and control groups in the second, third, and fourth years after SYEP participation.
Earnings. Compared with the control group, the treatment group earned $876 more in the year of participation, but approximately $100 less in each of the three years following SYEP participation. These findings were all statistically significant. In the fourth year after SYEP participation, there were no significant differences in the total earnings of the treatment and control group.
Educational attainment. There were no significant differences between those who participated in SYEP and those who did not in terms of college enrollment.","Youth were included in the sample for every year they applied to the SYEP program, even if they applied multiple times during the study period. For example, a particular youth applied for the program in the first study year, but was not selected in the lottery for that summer. For that year, the youth was a member of the control group. However, that same youth could apply again for the program in the subsequent summer, and if they won the lottery and chose to participate in the second year, then the youth would be part of the treatment group for that year. In total, the sample included 294,100 observations, which represented 198,454 people. The authors did not attempt to account for other characteristics of youth that might also have impacted the outcomes in the analysis (for example, individual fixed effects are not included); therefore, it is possible that the precision of the estimated effects of the SYEP program may be overstated.","",""

In 2011, the education grant for children ages 6 to 14 was $300 PHP per month (7 USD) per child for 10 months; up to 3 children were allowed to register for the grant. In 2012, the program was expanded to include children ages 15 to 17. As a requirement of the program, children must have 85 percent school attendance (children ages 3 to 5 needed day care with 85% attendance). The health grant required children 0-5 to receive preventative health check-ups, monitoring of growth, and vaccines. Pregnant women must get prenatal care and have a health worker professional with them during child birth, and mothers who have given birth need post-natal care as part of the Department of Health protocol. Additionally, children ages 6-14 need de-worming pills twice a year. Participants chosen for the 4Ps occurred through geographic and household targeting.

The program's goals were to provide education and health cash grants and provide human capital investments to combat intergenerational poverty. In 2011, the education grant for children ages 6 to 14 was $300 PHP per month (7 USD) per child for 10 months; up to 3 children were allowed to register for the grant. In 2012, the program was expanded to include children ages 15 to 17. As a requirement of the program, children must have 85 percent school attendance (children ages 3 to 5 needed day care with 85% attendance). The health grant required children 0-5 to receive preventative health check-ups, monitoring of growth, and vaccines. Pregnant women must get prenatal care and have a health worker professional with them during child birth, and mothers who have given birth need post-natal care as part of the Department of Health protocol. Additionally, children ages 6-14 need de-worming pills twice a year. Participants chosen for the 4Ps occurred through geographic and household targeting. Municipalities that had more than 50 percent poverty were considered ""very poor"" and those with less were “moderate poor”.

The study was a randomized controlled trial where eligible villages were randomly assigned to a control group that would not receive any benefits, or to one of four treatment groups that differed by agricultural season (lean vs. post-harvest) and payment schedule (lump sum vs. installments). Using household survey data, the authors analyzed the impact of the treatment conditions on school attendance and work 3-months, 6-months, and 12-months after implementation.
The study found that post-harvest program participation was significantly related to higher rates of paid work 6 months after participation, whereas lean harvest program participation was significantly related to higher rates of school attendance 6 months after participation.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to Malawi’s LIPW program, and not to other factors.","Absence of conflict of interest.","The Malawi Labour Intensive Public Works program (LIPW) is a cash transfer program, which has been in place for about 20 years, where households can temporarily work in public infrastructure projects and in exchange receive financial payment. The intervention took place in Malawi and was implemented by the local government. The program aimed to include low-income and vulnerable villages using a combination of established criteria and the judgement of local leadership and committees. The program was offered to households during the lean agriculture season or during the post-harvest agriculture season, and would either receive payment in one lump sum or in installments.","The study was a randomized controlled trial where 183 villages in Malawi were randomly assigned to the control group or one of the four treatment groups. Specifically, the treatment villages were randomly assigned to the post-harvest or lean group, which differed in terms of which agricultural seasons they received the second wave of the program, and were also randomly assigned to two payment schedule groups, where participants were either paid for their work at once or in installments. However, the report did not share results on differences between the two payment schedule groups.
Sixteen households within each village were randomly selected for participation. The treatment group households were able to participate in the work-based cash transfer program, while the control households did not receive any benefits during the study. The authors originally used the World Bank’s Integrated Household Survey (IHS-3) as a baseline measure but it did not include information for 24 villages. Therefore, the study used a different household survey to collect demographic and outcome data at baseline and follow-up. To assess program impact, the researchers compared child work and school attendance outcomes between the treatment and control groups at three follow-up time-points: 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after the program began. Child work was measured by whether the child had worked at all in the past seven days. School attendance was measured by whether children currently attend school, and also by whether they regularly attend school, which was determined through assessing whether they missed less than two weeks of school since the last survey. Analyses of child work participation outcomes included 2,889 children who were 10-16 years old at baseline when the intervention began, and analyses of school attendance outcomes included 5,467 children who were 5-16 years old at baseline.","Employment/Child labor 
Boys in the post-harvest season treatment group had a significantly higher rate of participation in work activities than boys in the control group 6 months after the start of the intervention. However, there were no significant differences in the work participation rates between boys in the post-harvest season treatment group and boys in the control group for the other two follow-up time points (3 months, 1 year). 
Boys in the lean treatment group did not have a significantly different rate of work participation than those in the control group for any of the follow-up time points (3 months, 6 months, 1 year).
Girls in both the post-harvest and lean treatment groups did not have a significantly different rate of work participation than those in the control group at any of the three follow-up times (3 months, 6 months, 1 year).
Education (School participation/enrollment)
School attendance was significantly higher for children in the lean treatment group than those in the control group 6 months after the program began. There were no significant differences in child attendance between the lean treatment and control group for any other follow-up time points.
There were no significant differences in child attendance between the post-harvest treatment group and the control group for each of the three time points.
There were also no significant differences between either the post-harvest or lean treatment groups and the control group in whether children regularly attended school at any follow-up time point.","The authors noted limitations with the baseline data. First, the IHS-3 data were unavailable for 24 villages. The authors used another survey to collect a second baseline to have data for all villages. However, baseline data were collected after program implementation in six percent of households.

It began in 2010 when a newly elected administration renamed and modified the former Programa de Asignacion Familiar (PRAF-II) conditional cash transfer programs. The Bono 10,000 program provided cash transfers to households in the 2,911 poorest of Honduras’ villages located primarily in the Western part of the country.
After signing a letter of commitment, households received Honduran Lempira (L) 10,000 (about $500 USD) if at least one child aged 6-18 enrolled in school. This was true regardless of how many children in the age range lived in the household. Households received L 5,000 ($250 USD) if children under age 6, and pregnant or nursing mothers, registered in a health center. The money was paid in three installments. The first was an unconditional payment of 1/12 the total amount after eligibility was determined. The second and third installments were contingent on school enrollment for at least one child 6-18, or registration in a health center for children under age 6 or pregnant or nursing mothers.","The study used a randomized controlled trial to examine the impact of Bono 10,000 on school enrollment and child labor. The sample was drawn from 816 untreated, and slightly less poor, villages. Villages were assigned to treatment and control groups by selecting numbered balls randomly, alternating assignment to treatment and control groups, until 300 villages were selected (150 treatment and 150 control). To select households within the villages, the Honduran government conducted a household census, then applied a proxy means test to obtain a list of ""nominally poor"" households. Researchers at NORC at the University of Chicago randomly sampled poor households from each village's list.
Baseline household surveys were conducted between January and June of 2012 and follow-up surveys were conducted between March and June of 2013. In the baseline survey, there were 2,137 households in the treatment group and 2,108 in the control group. In the follow-up survey, there were 1,973 households in the treatment group and 1,866 in the control group Child labor was measured by assessing if the child participated in paid or unpaid work in the week before the follow-up survey. School enrollment was measured by assessing if the child attended school in the week before the follow-up survey. Impacts were assessed using regression, with multiple controls (household size, age, child birth order) and interaction effects (enrollment in different grade levels and poverty). Data were analyzed using regression. While the program included 18-year-old individuals, analyses were restricted to children aged 6-17 for school enrollment and child labor participation.","Employment/Child labor

Types of child labor included household chores, farm labor (both at home and outside the home), and skill-forming activities defined as work in commerce, sales, or manufacturing activities outside the home.
The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted in six municipalities in Nicaragua. Households from each community were randomly assigned into treatment and control groups. Treatment households received either the basic CCT or the basic CCT plus an additional a household grant for the creation of a micro business. Survey data were collected and child labor outcomes were analyzed using two statistical models.
The study found that the program significantly reduced overall child labor, household chore labor, and farm labor for both treatment groups compared to the control group. The program had no effect on skill-forming labor for the treatment group that received the basic CCT but increased skill-forming labor for the children in the households that received the basic CCT plus the business grant.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial with low attrition. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Atención a Crisis program and not to other factors.","Absence of conflict of interest.","Atención a Crisis was a conditional cash transfer program implemented between November 2005 and December 2006 in six municipalities affected by a severe drought and classified as extremely poor in northwest Nicaragua. The program aimed to help poor households deal with the negative effects of the drought, as well as improve household economic outcomes. Households would receive payments, conditional on school attendance and health check-ups for children in the household. The households receiving the intervention were to receive one of three packages: a basic cash transfer; the basic cash option plus a scholarship for one member of the household 16 or older to attend occupational training; or the basic cash option plus a household grant to create a non-agricultural micro-business. The value of the cash transfers was between 25 percent and 45 percent of pre-program annual household income. Due to budget constraints, only 3,000 households could be treated under the program. Ultimately the scholarship option was not provided.","The program was designed as a randomized controlled trial to examine the effects of cash transfers on the amount and type of child labor conducted by children (ages 8-15). All communities from six municipalities were paired based on socio-economic and geographic factors and randomized into treatment and control communities based on a lottery. Within the treatment communities, the poorest 90 percent of households were offered the program. The invited households were then assigned by lottery to one of the treatment conditions. Ninety-five percent of invited households participated, but in order to avoid selection bias, the analysis was conducted on all invited households regardless of participation One thousand households were randomly selected from the control communities to represent the control group.
Originally, 3,000 treatment households were assigned to one of the three intervention packages (cash transfer, cash plus scholarship, or cash plus business grant). The scholarships for the second group ultimately were not provided, so the first and second conditions were combined. The baseline sample included 2,323 households with children between the ages of 7 and 14 (1,136 in the basic treatment group, 580 in the basic plus business grant treatment group, and 607 in the control group). Baseline survey data were collected in May/June 2005 and the follow-up occurred in August/September 2006 (hence the age range of 8-15 for analysis). The data collection months correspond to the same agricultural season and similar school period in Nicaragua. The authors used two statistical models to evaluate the effect on labor for children age 8-15.","Employment/Child labor
The study found a significant decrease in child labor hours among those in households receiving the CCT and the business grant compared to the control group. Children in these households worked, respectively, 1.8 and 0.9 fewer hours per week than those in the control group.
Children from households receiving the basic CCT worked less than those who received the CCT plus the business grant. Children in both the basic CCT and the CCT with the business grant worked fewer hours in household chores and farm labor than the control group, but children in the CCT with the business grant worked more in skill-forming labor than children in the control group or the basic CCT.
Children in the group receiving the CCT and business grant worked about one (1) less hour per week in household chores and 0.5 fewer hours in farming than children in the control group. Children in the basic CCT group worked about 0.9 fewer hours per week in household chores and 0.7 fewer hours in farming than children in the control group.
For children in the basic CCT group there was no statistical difference in the number of hours spent on skill-forming labor compared to those in the control group, but children from households also receiving the business grant worked about one (1) hour more per week in skill-forming activities than those in the control group (and those receiving the basic CCT).
All findings were statistically significant unless otherwise noted.","The study does not report attrition separately for each group. However, the overall household attrition between baseline and follow-up was 1.3 percent and it is unlikely that the difference in the rate of attrition between the treatment and control groups would exceed 5.8 percent.","",""

The study was a regression discontinuity design, using baseline and follow-up household surveys to measure program outcomes. Households were selected into the program if they had a wealth score below a cut-off point. The authors compared the outcomes of children in households above and below the cut-off score to understand the program’s effects.
The study found that selection and participation in the program was significantly associated with a decrease in the percent of children working-only and not attending school, and the number of hours that children worked per week. Selection and participation in the program was also significantly related to an increase in school attendance.
This study used a regression discontinuity design and therefore was reviewed using CLEAR’s descriptive study evidence review guidelines. As such, it does not receive a causal rating.","Absence of conflict of interest.","The Eliminating Child Labour in El Salvador through Economic Empowerment and Social Inclusion program was implemented by the International Labour Organization, World Bank, and UNICEF to reduce child labor. The program took place in five El Salvador municipalities: Tacuba, Izalco, San Luis la Herradura, Tecoluca, Santiago Nonualco. These five municipalities were selected because they were located relatively close to one another, and they met criteria of having a high rate of child labor, being sufficiently safe for field workers, and having enough residents to conduct the study. The program provided entrepreneurship training and a business starter kit for mothers. The women were also offered training to help transition students who were not attending school back to school, but this component was not utilized by many participants. Households were eligible to participate if at least one of the children in their household was working and aged 5-17, and also if there was at least one woman in the household (aged 18-65) who was literate but did not have salaried employment.","The study used a regression discontinuity design (RDD), where participating households were selected into the treatment group based on whether they were below a cut-off score on a wealth index. The authors used baseline survey data to create the wealth index; however, they did not specify the value of the cut-off point that was used. Those with a lower score than the cut-off were eligible for the treatment group that received program services (1,098 households) and those with a higher score were in the comparison group that did not receive any program services (1,000 households). The study sample included children who were aged 5-15 at the time of the baseline survey. A follow-up survey was administered 3 years after the baseline survey to assess child work and school participation outcomes. For the follow-up survey, the sample included 794 treatment households and 702 comparison households. In addition to assessing any work participation for children aged 5-13, the study assessed work for more than 34 hours per week or in hazardous conditions for children aged 14-15, or work in hazardous conditions for children aged 16-17. The authors used a RDD statistical model to compare the outcomes of the groups above and below the cut-off score for wealth to assess the impact of being selected for the program. The outcome analyses were focused on the households within a limited range (or bandwidth) around the wealth cutoff score. The study presented intent-to-treat analyses (which can be interpreted as the impact of being offered the program) in addition to analyses of those who participated in the program (treatment-on-the-treated).","Employment/Child labor
The study found that selection and participation in the program was not significantly related to children’s rates of employment or rates of working in hazardous conditions.
For children’s allocation of time between school and work, the study found that selection and participation in the program was significantly associated with lower rates of working-only and not attending school. However, selection and participation in the program was not significantly related to rates of studying-only or rates of both working and studying.
The study found that selection and participation in the program was significantly related to a decrease in the number of hours that children worked per week.
Education (School participation/enrollment)
The study found that selection and participation in the program was significantly associated with higher rates of school attendance. However, selection and participation in the program was not significantly related to the regularity of children’s school attendance.","","",""

The authors randomly assigned people who had been employed for at least 10 years and had yet to claim Social Security benefits to receive different messages about claiming the benefits. Each message contained the same financial information, but the information was presented—or framed—in different ways. There were 10 different messages—9 treatment conditions and one control condition that presented neutral information. Each study participant received 6 of the 10 messages.
The study found that, on average, those presented with the break-even treatment were more likely to indicate a younger intended age to receive benefits compared with those presented with the control condition, whereas those who received 4 of the other treatment conditions expressed an older intended age compared with the control condition.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because it was based on a randomized controlled trial with unknown attrition and the authors did not ensure that the groups being compared were similar before the intervention. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the framing of information about the age at which Social Security is collected; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","","To be eligible for the study, participants must not have already collected Social Security, must have worked for at least 10 years, and must not have retired yet (the study excluded those older than 55 who self-identified as retired). Of the baseline sample of 1,437 participants, 58.4 percent were women and 83.9 percent had some college, an associate’s degree, or higher education. Furthermore, 27.0 percent of the sample were ages 18 to 40, 28.2 percent were 41 to 50, 19.1 percent were 51 to 55, and 25.7 percent were older than 55. About one-fifth (21.1 percent) of the baseline sample had less than $35,000 in household income; 41.2 percent had household income from $35,000 to $74,999; and 37.7 percent had household income greater than $75,000.
The authors investigated whether the way in which information about Social Security benefits was presented could affect the age at which people intended to collect the benefits. RAND American Life Panel conducted a panel survey over three waves to test 10 different messages containing this information, including one neutral message that served as the control condition. Survey respondents received the same financial information in the following framing scenarios: the age of Social Security claiming as a break-even (anchored age 62) analysis, in which people who lived long enough would recoup foregone benefits before the age of claiming; eight different combinations of Social Security collection as the loss or gain of consumption or investment power anchored at different ages (62, 66, or 70); or a control condition with the same information presented in a symmetric and neutral fashion. Each survey respondent was randomly assigned to receive 6 different messages, 2 for each of the three waves of the survey (conducted about every two weeks). The authors examined the expected age at which respondents would collect Social Security benefits, measured as the number of months after the respondent turned 62 years old.","Framing information about the age at which Social Security is collected as a break-even analysis caused individuals to report they intended to claim benefits 22 months earlier, on average, than those exposed to the control condition.
Framing information about the age at which Social Security is collected as either a consumption or investment gain anchored at 66 years of age caused individuals to report they intended to claim benefits three months later, on average, than those exposed to the control condition.
Framing information about the age at which Social Security is collected as a consumption or investment loss anchored at 70 years of age caused individuals to report they intended to claim benefits about two to three months later, on average, than those exposed to the control condition.","Because respondents were presented with multiple frames within and across survey waves, there was the potential of spillover effects if respondents remembered their answers from the previous wave and adjusted their answers to be consistent.","",""

The study also examined the impact of Florida’s REA program compared with the control group. CLEAR’s profile of that study is available here.","","The PREP program was Florida’s Worker Profiling and Reemployment Services program. Program staff used UI administrative records to identify claimants at risk of exhausting regular UI benefits and referred them to a group orientation at a local One-Stop Career Center (now known as American Job Centers).

This study extended the work of Johnson and Klepinger (1991), the CLEAR profile of which is available here. The CLEAR profile of a related study, Lachowska et al. (2015), is available here.
The study examined data from a randomized controlled trial conducted in the 1980s in Washington State. UI claimants were randomly assigned to one of four groups, each with different work search requirements and/or verification of that work search. The authors used administrative data to compare the outcomes of the groups up to nine years after the initial UI claims.
The study found that the groups with more-stringent work search requirements were more likely to be employed than the group with less-stringent requirements in the first year following their claims. They also received UI benefits payments for fewer weeks, exhausted UI benefits at a lower rate, and received fewer conditional payments in the year following their initial UI claims.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the more stringent work search requirements, and not to other factors.","","In general, a work test (also referred to as a work search requirement) enables UI administrators to identify whether beneficiaries have become employed or stopped seeking employment after their initial UI claims; in either case, claimants would stop receiving UI benefits. The Washington Alternative Work Search (WAWS) experiment targeted UI claimants who had worked 680 or more hours in the year before filing their UI claims, were able and available for work, were laid off due to no fault of their own, and were registered with Public Employment Service unless under union placement or temporary layoff.
Eligible UI claimants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions:
Standard work test. Claimants faced work search requirements typical in most states at the time: they were required to make at least three employer contacts per week in their primary industry and to participate in eligibility review interviews focused on work search activities 13 to 15 weeks after filing initial claims.
Modified work test. Claimants were required to submit biweekly continued claims and to attend an eligibility review interview four weeks after submitting their claims, during which they developed employability strategies.
No work test. Claimants received their customary weekly benefits unless they reported a change in status; this operated essentially as an honor system in which claimants were assumed to remain eligible for benefits and encouraged to participate in work search activities but were not obligated to report on those efforts.
Job search assistance. Claimants who remained unemployed after receiving benefits for four weeks were required to attend a two-day job-search training session. Those who were still unemployed after 12 weeks were required to attend an eligibility review interview to develop employability strategies.
For this study, the authors excluded the job search assistance services group from the analysis. The study included 1,539 claimants in the standard work test group, 1,073 claimants in the modified work test group, and 1,606 claimants in the no work test group. This sample included those randomly assigned from July 1986 to May 1987, which is a subset of the full WAWS experimental sample reported in Johnson and Klepinger (1991).
Participants were predominantly white men. About 40 percent were ages 25 to 34, and 54 to 57 percent of participants had at least a high school degree. The authors collected data from the original WAWS experiment and Washington Employment Security Department’s quarterly UI administrative wage records for up to three years before the claim quarter and nine years following the claim quarter. The authors compared the outcomes of claimants in the three groups using statistical methods.","","The study found that the modified work test group—which faced more-stringent work search requirements than the no work test control group—had a higher employment rate in the quarter after their claims (4 percentage points) and full year after their claims (3 percentage points), compared with the no work test group. However, the study did not find any other significant impacts on employment or earnings outcomes for either the standard work test group or modified work test group, compared with the no work test group.
The study also found that one year after the claim quarter, claimants in the standard work test group received $429 fewer in UI benefits and had three fewer weeks of UI benefits receipt compared with the no work test group. The standard work test group also exhausted their UI benefits at a lower rate than the no work test group.
Similarly, the modified work test group received $484 less in UI benefits and had three fewer weeks of UI benefits receipt in the year after the claim quarter compared with the no work test group. The modified work test group also exhausted their UI benefits at a lower rate than the no work test group.","The authors used different naming conventions for the study groups than were reported in the original Johnson and Klepinger (1991) study and in Lachowska et al (2015). They also designated the treatment and control groups differently, making it difficult to compare the findings across the studies. Generally speaking, the balance of evidence from the studies of WAWS suggests that the less-stringent work search requirements, as implemented in the group known as exception reporting or no work test, depending on the study, led to lower short-term employment and higher short-term UI benefit receipt duration, total amount, and likelihood of exhausting benefits than standard or slightly modified work search requirements. The long-term employment and short- and long-term earnings of claimants subject to the less-stringent work search requirements were no better or worse than those of the groups subject to more-stringent work search requirements.","",""

The author estimated the program’s effects by comparing these groups’ post-release employment, earnings, and recidivism outcomes using data from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, Minnesota Department of Corrections, and the Minnesota Department of Employee and Economic Development.
The author found that, on average, program participation decreased the risk of reconviction by 14 percent and of re-incarceration by 17 percent, but increased the risk of participants having their supervised release revoked for a technical violation by 78 percent.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate for outcomes related to recidivism and low for post-release employment and earnings outcomes. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects on recidivism are attributable to the work release program, although other factors might also have contributed, and we are not confident that the estimated effects on employment and earnings are attributable to the program; other factors are likely to have contributed.","Absence of conflict of interest.","The Minnesota Department of Correction’s work release program was established in 1967. The program provides employment services in both correctional facilities and the community to low-risk offenders who have served at least half of their sentence and are within eight months of their supervised release date. Individuals first learn about the program during an orientation session when they enter the Minnesota prison system. Once inmates are within a year of their release date, they can apply to participate in the work release program. To be eligible, participants cannot have a prior sex offense or an offense that would require them to register as a predatory offender, and they cannot have a high recidivism risk based on their criminal history, behavior within prison, or score on the Revised Level of Service Inventory. Participants begin program services within the final 60 to 90 days of their release by engaging in job searches based on their vocational skills, contacting “felon-friendly” employers, and working with staff to address employment barriers through skills assessments, resume preparation, learning job-searching techniques, and building interviewing skills. Post-release, participants receive a portfolio with copies of their resume, certifications, and job leads. Participants continue receiving employment assistance for up to one year following their release and maintain regular contact with program staff to receive assistance with job leads and resume maintenance.","The author used a statistical approach (propensity score matching) to compare post-release employment, earnings, and recidivism outcomes between the treatment and comparison groups. A total of 1,785 offenders who participated in the work release program between 2007 and 2010 made up the treatment group while the most closely matched 1,785 nonparticipants (of a total pool of 6,841 nonparticipants) made up the comparison group. Program participants and comparison group members were drawn from county jails and residential facilities operated by community corrections. The author used statistical models to compare program participants’ outcomes to those of comparison group members using data on employment and earnings from the Minnesota Department of Employee and Economic Development, data on reconvictions from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, and data on re-incarcerations and revocations from the Minnesota Department of Corrections.","Employment. Work release program participation was associated with a greater likelihood of attaining employment in the two years after release.
Earnings. Work release program participation was associated with higher earnings over the first two years after release.
Recidivism. Participating in the work release program decreased the risk of reconviction by 14 percent and the risk of re-incarceration by 17 percent. These differences were statistically significant. Participating in the program increased the risk of participants having their supervised release revoked by 78 percent.","Although the author used a well-implemented nonexperimental design to examine the relationship between participation in the work release program and recidivism outcomes, the author did not account for potential differences between the treatment and comparison groups’ employment and earnings histories before the program. Additionally, because the treatment group comprised individuals who applied to the work release program and the comparison group consisted of individuals who were eligible but did not apply for the program, unobservable factors, such as individual motivation, might have contributed to the estimated effects. This study found a significant relationship between the intervention and recidivism due to technical violations of probation or parole. As the author noted, work release participants are subject to greater surveillance than offenders placed on regular supervision, which may explain the treatment groups’ higher rates of revocation. However, because the definition of a technical violation can vary by jurisdiction, it is unclear whether these findings are generalizable to other contexts.","",""

The authors compared differences in outcomes between long-term sick-listed workers whose absence started in July 2004 through June 2006 and those whose absence started in January 2009 through December 2010, during which time the DM program became compulsory. The authors used salary and social insurance data from the Norwegian Social Security Administration (SSA) to measure program impacts.
The study found that increasing the probability of a sick-listed worker attending a DM resulted in a significant increase in base salary, for those who returned to full-time employment, of $1,436. It also resulted in a significantly lower probability of receiving temporary disability benefits two years later for those who returned to full-time employment (1.4 percent) and those who returned to either part- or full-time employment (2.3 percent).
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not establish the comparability of the treatment and comparison groups. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to compulsory DMs; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Workers in Norway who go on long-term sick leave are paid their base salary for the first year of their absence. The employer covers the salary for the first 16 days, and the Norwegian SSA provides coverage for the remainder of the year. Approximately 6 months (26 weeks) into the absence, the SSA organizes a compulsory DM between the worker, the employer, and if necessary, the physician who authorized the sick leave. During this meeting, the parties discuss whether arrangements can be made at the workplace to facilitate the worker’s full or partial return to work.","Because of differences in the operations of local SSA offices, the timing of the DMs and issuing of exemptions from them varied across counties, such that some sick-listed workers were not invited to a DM during the first 52 weeks of their absence. The authors incorporated this local variation into their design to estimate the probability that a sick-listed worker attended a DM. Specifically, the authors modeled the effect of a change in the probability of attending a DM on earnings and insurance receipt, moving from the lowest to highest average probabilities observed across counties.
Long-term earnings and social insurance receipt were measured two years after the beginning of an individual’s spell of absence. Long-term sick-listed workers who began a spell of full-time absence in July 2004 through June 2006 were compared to those beginning spells in January 2009 through December 2010, during which time DMs became compulsory. In both periods, workers with absence spells lasting long enough to lead to an invitation to a DM were compared to those with shorter spells who were not likely to experience a DM. The impacts that the authors estimated can be interpreted as a comparison of the difference in outcomes before and after the introduction of compulsory DMs for those with long spells (and likely to be affected by the policy) relative to those with short spells (and not likely to be affected by the policy) across counties with varying probabilities of inviting sick-listed workers to a DM.
The study included 129,656 and 151,911 individuals from the non-compulsory and compulsory DM periods, respectively, across all 19 counties in Norway. Approximately 60 percent of long-term sick-listed workers were women, with an average age of 44 and a base salary of $29,000. On average, workers were absent for a period of 40 weeks.","The study found that an increase in the probability of a sick-listed worker attending a DM, from the lowest county-level probability to the highest county-level probability, resulted in a significant increase ($1,436) in base salary for those who returned to full-time employment.
An increase in the probability of attending a DM from the lowest county-level probability to the highest county-level probability resulted in a significant decrease in the probability of receiving temporary disability benefits two years later by 1.4 percent for those who returned to full-time employment, and 2.3 percent for those who returned to either part-time or full-time employment.","The authors controlled for differences between the treatment and comparison groups in many individual demographic and employment characteristics. However, they did not show equivalent trends in baseline earnings or benefit receipt outcomes between groups before the compulsory DMs came into effect. This is important because, among other things, the introduction of compulsory DMs could have led workers to change the timing and length of their absences from work, introducing systematic differences in earnings or benefit receipt between the treatment and comparison groups. Workers might have extended their absences to receive the treatment, making them systematically different from those in the comparison group with short spells. This means that the estimated impacts may reflect differences between the groups in addition to the effect of compulsory DMs.","",""

The study did not find any statistically significant effects of the brochure on the employment or earnings outcomes of the treatment group relative to the control group. However, the study did find positive impacts of the brochure on earnings and employment outcomes for the subgroup of individuals who had been identified as being at risk of long-term unemployment.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the informational brochure, and not to other factors.","","","One-hundred sixty thousand individuals who had recently registered for unemployment insurance in Germany were randomly assigned to either a treatment group, which was mailed an informational brochure, or a control group, which was not mailed a brochure. Individuals were eligible for the study if they were German citizens between the ages of 25 and 55. Individuals were excluded if they had re-registered for unemployment after having participated in a training program, were civil servants, or were self-employed. Random assignment occurred in four waves between October 2010 and January 2011; in each wave, the authors randomly assigned 10,000 eligible individuals to the treatment group and 30,000 eligible individuals to the control group.
The brochure was designed to inform and motivate unemployed individuals to find work. It consisted of four parts: (1) facts about the current labor market in Germany, (2) information on the benefits of job search efforts and the association of longer unemployment spells with lower rates of finding jobs, (3) evidence of beneficial health and other non-financial outcomes associated with employment, and (4) job search resources.
The authors analyzed data from the Integrated Employment Biographies, an administrative data source available through the German Federal Employment Agency, which contains information on individuals’ employment status, earnings, gender, age, and education level. The authors estimated regression models comparing the employment and earnings outcomes of the treatment and control group members for 52 weeks after the brochure was mailed.","The study did not find any statistically significant effects of the brochure on employment or earnings outcomes of the treatment group as a whole relative to the control group as a whole.
The brochure had a statistically significant effect on employment and earnings for the subgroup of individuals identified as being at risk of long-term unemployment; for this subgroup, individuals in the treatment group were employed for 4.78 days more and had average earnings of 446.20 EUR higher than individuals in the control group over the 52 weeks following the intervention.","The authors noted that, although the estimated impacts were small and confined to the subgroup that had been identified as being at risk of long-term employment, the intervention itself was very low-cost, and thus might have been cost-effective.","",""

Using survey data from a cluster randomized controlled trial, the authors analyzed the average program impact of the PROGRESA/Oportunidades program on indigenous households versus individuals who were bilingual or Spanish-speaking.
The study found that the PROGRESA/Oportunidades program was significantly related to a decrease in child labor and an increase in school attendance for indigenous speaking children.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is low because it was based on a randomized controlled trial with unknown attrition and the authors did not control for the required variables. As a result, we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to PROGRESA/Oportunidades; other factors are likely to have contributed.","Absence of Conflict of Interest.","Since 1997, the PROGRESA/Oportunidades program has provided monthly conditional cash transfers, which is approximately 20 percent of the average total household income. By 2012, PROGRESA/Oportunidades had served 5.8 million households in Mexico. The cash transfer is conditional upon child school attendance (85% of days) for children aged 8-17, and health clinic visits for household members, as well as the requirement for pregnant women and lactating women to take nutritional supplements and go to five pre-natal visits. The amount of the cash transfer varies by gender as girls are more likely to drop out of school at younger ages and increased with the grade of the child. However, if a child repeats a grade twice, he or she will permanently lose the cash transfer.","The study used survey data from a randomized controlled trial across rural communities in seven states in Mexico (320 in the treatment; 185 in the control). Poor households, based on a marginality index, were selected to participate in the program. In this study, authors used the 1997 baseline survey of Household Socioeconomic Characteristics (ENCASEH) as well as the Mexican national household survey, Encuesta de Evaluacion de los Hogares, in 2000, 1999, and 1997. The authors use multinomial logit, sequential probit, and difference- in-difference regressions, looking at differences between individuals who speak the indigenous language, those were bilingual, and those who were Spanish-speaking on the outcomes of child labor and school attendance. The difference-in-differences (DID) model explored the effect of PROGRESA/Oportunidades on the three language groups (indigenous, Spanish, and bilingual).","Employment/Child labor
The study showed that participation in PROGRESA/Oportunidades was significantly related to a decrease in the probability of working among children aged 8-17 in all language groups, with the largest reduction among indigenous speaking children.

At the three participating schools, eligible students were randomly assigned to the treatment group, which could participate in ASAP, or to the control group, which could not participate in ASAP but could access existing services at the schools. The primary data sources were a baseline information form, the CUNY Institutional Research Database, and National Student Clearinghouse records.
The study found that students in the ASAP group were significantly more likely to earn a degree from any college in the fourth, fifth, and sixth semesters following random assignment, compared with the control group. In addition, during the sixth semester following random assignment, the treatment group was significantly more likely to be enrolled in a four-year college than the control group. Over the six semesters of the study, students in the treatment group earned significantly more total credits, college-level credits, and developmental credits than the control group.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-conducted randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to ASAP and not to other factors.","","ASAP provided services and support to students for up to three years. Students in the program had to enroll full-time in courses; program staff advised students to complete developmental courses as soon as possible and encouraged them to graduate in three years. The program provided students access to advisors, career and employment specialists, and tutoring. In addition, students in ASAP took an ASAP seminar course, and were offered the opportunity to take blocked or linked courses, in which most students would be fellow ASAP participants. The program also provided a transportation stipend and free use of textbooks. A small portion of participants received tuition waivers and scholarships for transferring to a four-year program at a CUNY college.
Students were eligible to participate in the program if they (1) were Pell Grant-eligible or had family income less than 200 percent of the national poverty level; (2) needed to take at least one developmental course; (3) held 12 or fewer credits and a 2.0 grade point average, or were newly enrolled students; (4) were New York City residents; (5) were willing to attend college full-time; and (6) were pursuing an ASAP-eligible major. Most majors were eligible for ASAP, although each participating school excluded certain majors—such as nursing, allied health sciences, and engineering science—because their requirements made graduating within three years challenging.","The study examined three of six CUNY community colleges implementing ASAP: Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC), Kingsborough Community College (KCC), and LaGuardia Community College (LGCC). The schools participated in the study for three years. The study included two cohorts, one entering the program in spring 2010 and the other in fall 2010.
The authors identified 8,520 community college students eligible for ASAP and invited them to participate in the study. In total, 896 students consented to participate in the study and were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which could participate in ASAP, or the control group, which could not participate in ASAP but could access existing services at the schools. Control group members took a freshman seminar or student success course during their first year at the school; at two of the schools, control group students could enroll in existing blocked courses. Random assignment at BMCC and KCC occurred before the spring and fall 2010 semesters; at LGCC, random assignment occurred before the fall 2010 semester only.
The study sample was predominantly female and the average age was 21.5 years old. About 44 percent of the sample was Hispanic, 34 percent was African American, and 10 percent was white. A third of the sample were returning students, 60 percent were newly enrolled freshman, and 7 percent were transfer students.
The authors used students’ demographic information from a baseline information form, their transcript information from the CUNY Institutional Research Database, and enrollment and degree completion information from the National Student Clearinghouse. The authors estimated regression models comparing the outcomes of treatment and control group members for six semesters following random assignment. The three schools had different term lengths, so the authors defined the spring semester as both the spring and summer terms and the fall semester as both the fall and winter terms.","Students in the ASAP group were significantly more likely than the control group to earn a degree from any college in the fourth, fifth, and sixth semesters following random assignment.
In addition, 25 percent of the treatment group was enrolled in a four-year college in the sixth semester after random assignment, compared with 17 percent of the control group. This difference was statistically significant.
The treatment group earned significantly more total, college-level, and developmental credits cumulatively across the six semesters. In each of the six semesters of the study, students in the ASAP group were significantly more likely to complete developmental requirements than the control group students.","The treatment condition was implemented differently among the three colleges. For example, at two schools, the career services focused on long-term career goals, whereas career services at the third school focused on short-term career goals. At two of the schools, a freshman seminar course that was also offered to control students replaced the ASAP seminar. In addition, the types of courses offered as blocked courses, as well as the level of encouragement for students to take the blocked courses, varied by school.","",""

The study used a nonexperimental design in which the author compared the labor market outcomes of UI claimants in different states who were subject to different job search requirements between 2001 and 2013.
The study found that an increase in the number of required contacts with employers was associated with decreases in the unemployment rate. Accounting for expected employment growth along with changes in the number of required contacts also decreased the unemployment rate. The study found no statistically significant relationships between the number of required contacts and UI claim duration.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the author did not account for differences in the age of UI claimants in the analysis. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to required contacts with employers; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","UI provides monetary assistance to full-time workers who lose employment through no fault of their own. To balance the benefits of UI with the potential risks of incentivizing continued unemployment, UI claimants typically must demonstrate that they are actively searching for employment each week to remain eligible to receive UI benefits. Although search requirements vary by state and time, most states require UI claimants to contact a minimum number of prospective employers per week. In recent decades, many states implemented more stringent employer contact requirements for UI claimants.","The author used a nonexperimental design to examine the impact of changes in the number of required contacts on unemployment and UI claims duration. Specifically, the author used data from workforce agency publications, the Current Population Survey, Department of Labor quarterly reports, Local Area Unemployment Statistics, and Quarterly Workforce Indicators to examine the impact of different contact requirements on labor market outcomes across states from 2001 to 2013. UI claimants eligible for the study were 25 to 65 years old, unemployed, and actively searching for employment. They also had to have lost their employment or been laid off. The author used information on the number of required contacts with employers, which ranged from zero to five during the study period. The author conducted statistical analyses to compare the outcomes of claimants subject to more required contacts with employers to those with fewer or no requirements on reemployment, unemployment, and UI claims duration.","The study found that areas with an increase in required contacts experienced a 0.2 percentage point decrease in the unemployment rate when unemployment was below the state median in 2001 (the beginning of the study period).
Similarly, the study found that areas with an increase in required contacts experienced a 0.4 percentage point decrease in the unemployment rate when unemployment was below the state median in the period just before the change in requirements.
The study found no statistically significant relationships between required contacts with employers and UI claims duration.","Although the statistical analysis accounted for several factors that could influence unemployment and UI claims duration, such as claimants’ occupation, education, and sex, the author did not account for claimants’ age. Differences in claimants’ age and in the age composition of the workforce over time may partly account for observed differences in outcomes between UI claimants who experienced different employer contact requirements. This possibility is a concern because the study covers a relatively long time period (2001–2013) and includes several recession years. Without explicitly including age in the analysis, the estimated impacts may reflect the effect of differences in age across groups on unemployment rates and UI claim duration rather than the effect of employer contact requirements.","",""

The authors conducted a randomized controlled trial, sending different combinations of materials to likely eligible taxpayers who had not previously claimed the EITC. They used tax data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax year 2009.
The study found that use of complex materials and a longer worksheet decreased the EITC take-up rate by 6 and 4 percentage points, respectively. Materials that displayed the potential tax credit amount increased the EITC take-up rate by 8 percentage points.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the experimental mailings, and not to other factors.","","","Many low-income taxpayers are eligible for the EITC, which must be claimed on tax forms submitted to the IRS each year. Eligibility for the EITC and the tax credit received, if eligible, depend primarily on the number of hours worked, total earnings, and number of dependents claimed by the taxpayer. The IRS sends taxpayers who are likely eligible for the EITC but do not claim it a notice alerting them of the EITC and a worksheet to claim the credit retroactively. Response rates to the mailing, and thus take-up of EITC, have historically been lower than desired.
The study’s objective was to examine the impact of different mailing materials on the EITC take-up rate among eligible taxpayers who did not respond to the first mailing. Through their collaboration with the IRS, the authors gained access to several years of tax data on EITC-eligible individuals. The authors manipulated three aspects of the mailing:
The envelope. A control envelope had no messaging on it, while a treatment envelope was printed with the message, “Important—Good News for You (Importante—Buenas Noticias para Usted)” to test whether encouraging recipients to open the envelope would affect take-up.
The worksheet: Each household received a worksheet assessing EITC eligibility.To test whether the length and complexity of the worksheet affected take-up, a simple version of the worksheet contained fewer eligibility screens than a more complex version.
To test whether recipients’ perceptions of potential penalties affected take-up, half of the worksheets contained a headline assuring them that mistakenly reporting incorrect information would not result in a penalty (known as indemnification).

The notice. Each household received a notice informing them of their potential eligibility for the EITC.To test whether the simplicity of the notice affected take-up, the authors compared a simple, single-sided notice with clear font and streamlined information to a more complex, two-sided notice. The complex notice was textually dense and repeated eligibility requirements that were also discussed in the worksheet.
To test whether additional information affected take-up, a version of the notice contained information about size of benefit receipt while another version of the notice displayed information about the transaction cost, either noting that the worksheet could be completed in less than 60 or 10 minutes. To test whether general program information affected take-up, some notices included a one-page informational flyer explaining the formula for calculating benefit amount and describing program “myths and realities.”
To test whether program stigma affected take-up, one version of the notice contained a message intended to reduce personal stigma, “You may have earned a refund due to your many hours of employment,” and another version contained a message intended to reduce social stigma, “Usually, four out of every five people claim their refund.”

The 35,050 study participants were California residents who were likely eligible for EITC in tax year 2009, who did not claim an EITC benefit in tax year 2009, who had received a first reminder note about EITC, and who did not respond to the first reminder note. The authors conducted a randomized controlled trial by assigning participants to versions of the materials using three separate randomizations, one each for the notice, worksheet, and envelope. All study participants received some type of mailing. The authors estimated regression models to determine the impact of the various treatments on subsequent claiming of the EITC.","Overall, 23 percent of taxpayers receiving the control mailing—the simple notice, simple worksheet, and plain envelope—responded to the mailing.
Compared with the simple versions of the notice and the worksheet, the complex notice decreased the response rate by 6 percentage points and the longer worksheet decreased the response rate by 4 percentage points. These results were statistically significant.
Compared with the simple notice alone, the simple notice plus a potential tax credit amount display increased the response rate by 8 percentage points. However, the simple notice plus informational flyer decreased the response rate by 4 percentage points. These results were statistically significant.
Compared with the simple notice alone, the simple notice plus a note designed to reduce social stigma decreased the response rate by 4 percentage points. These results were statistically significant.
There were no effects of providing estimates of the time required to complete the worksheet, indemnifying taxpayers against errors, the message on the envelope, or messages to reduce personal stigma on the EITC take-up rate.","The study focused solely on EITC-eligible taxpayers who did not originally claim the EITC and who had not responded to a previous prompt to claim the EITC. Therefore, these results apply only to similar populations and should not be generalized to all taxpayers, or even all EITC-eligible taxpayers.","",""

This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Transitional Living, and not to other factors.","","The Transitional Living program, now called YVLifeset, provided services to youth transitioning out of foster care or juvenile justice custody. Youth met with a case worker in a series of weekly sessions. The program began with an individual assessment and development of an individual treatment plan. Youth then engaged in a series of activities, such as counseling, referrals to other services, financial assistance, group social and learning activities, and educational and vocational coordination. Most youth participated in the program for nine months.","The authors used a randomized controlled trial to examine the impact of program participation on education, employment, earnings, and arrests, comparing outcomes in the 12 to 14 months following randomization. Youth who met all the criteria and expressed an interest in the program were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control condition. Youth randomly assigned to the control group received a list of alternative social service providers in their community. Youth randomly assigned to the treatment group could choose to participate in the Transitional Living program.
From October 2010 to October 2012, 1,322 youth ages 18 to 24 who were involved in the foster care or juvenile justice systems were randomly assigned into the study sample. Among youth in the study sample, 60 percent (N = 788) were assigned to the treatment group, and 40 percent (N = 534) were assigned to the control group. Of the full study sample, 71 percent of the youth were 18 years old, 51 percent were white, 37 percent were black, 54 percent had ever been employed, and 64 percent had been arrested at some point. Half of the full sample had been in state custody because of involvement with the justice system.
Outcome data on education, earnings, and criminal involvement came from a 12-month survey conducted by the authors. Data on program participation, including services received, came from the Transitional Living program’s management information system. Data on program implementation came from observations, a staff survey, and interviews with Transitional Living staff. Data on postsecondary school enrollment data came from the National Student Clearinghouse database.
To calculate the impact of the program, the authors compared the regression-adjusted means of the treatment group with the control group. The difference in means is the impact of the program. The authors used statistical tests to determine if the means of the two groups differed significantly.","The study found a statistically significant impact on earnings.

This study extended the work of Johnson and Klepinger (1991), the CLEAR profile of which is available here. The CLEAR profile of a related study, Lachowska et al. (2016), is available here.
The study examined data from a randomized controlled trial conducted in the 1980s in Washington State. UI claimants were randomly assigned to one of four groups, each with different work search requirements and/or verification of that work search. The authors used administrative data to compare the outcomes of the groups up to nine years after the initial UI claims.
The study found that the group with less-stringent work-search requirements was significantly less likely to be employed in the first quarter following their claims, compared with the groups with more-stringent requirements. In addition, they received more UI benefit payments for more weeks and exhausted UI benefits at a higher rate during the year following their initial claims.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the less-stringent work search requirements, and not to other factors.","","In general, a work test (also referred to as a work search requirement) enables UI administrators to identify whether beneficiaries have become employed or stopped seeking employment after their initial UI claims; in either case, claimants would stop receiving UI benefits. The Washington Alternative Work Search (WAWS) experiment targeted UI claimants who had worked 680 or more hours in the year before filing their UI claims, were able and available for work, were laid off due to no fault of their own, and were registered with Public Employment Service unless under union placement or temporary layoff.
Eligible UI claimants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions:
Exception reporting. Claimants received their customary weekly benefits unless they reported a change in status; this operated essentially as an honor system in which claimants were assumed to remain eligible for benefits and encouraged to participate in work search activities but were not obligated to report on those efforts.
New work search. Claimants were required to submit biweekly continued claims and to attend an eligibility review interview four weeks after submitting their claims, during which they developed employability strategies.
Standard work search. Claimants faced work search requirements typical in most states at the time: they were required to make at least three employer contacts per week in their primary industry and to participate in eligibility review interviews focused on work search activities 13 to 15 weeks after filing initial claims.
Job search assistance. Claimants who remained unemployed after receiving benefits for 4 weeks were required to attend a two-day job-search training session. Those who were still unemployed after 12 weeks were required to attend an eligibility review interview to develop employability strategies.
For this study, the authors excluded the job search assistance services group from the analysis and combined the new work search and standard work search requirement groups into one pooled control group. The study included 1,606 claimants in the exception-reporting group and 2,612 claimants in the control group. This sample included those randomly assigned from July 1986 to May 1987, which is a subset of the full WAWS experimental sample reported in Johnson and Klepinger (1991).
Participants were predominantly white men. About 40 percent were ages 25 to 34, and 54 to 57 percent of participants had at least a high school degree. The authors collected data from the original WAWS experiment and Washington Employment Security Department’s quarterly UI administrative wage records for up to three years before the claim quarter and nine years following the claim quarter. The authors compared the outcomes of claimants in the exception reporting group with those of the pooled comparison group using statistical methods.","","The study found that claimants in the exception-reporting group—which faced less stringent work search requirements—were 3 percentage points less likely to be employed in the year in the first quarter following their claims, compared with the control group. The study found no other statistically significant differences in employment or earnings outcomes between the groups during any of the nine years of the follow-up period.
In addition, one year after the initial claims, claimants in the exception-reporting group received about $451 more in UI benefits, received UI benefits for 3.26 more weeks, and were 11 percent more likely to exhaust UI benefits, compared with the control group.","To increase statistical precision, the authors combined the standard work search requirement group and the new work search group to form a pooled control group. They noted that earlier published reports did not find any differences between the impacts of the standard work search requirement and new work search groups.
In a later study, Lachowska et al. (2016), the authors used different naming conventions for the study groups than were reported in both this study and the original Johnson and Klepinger (1991) study. They also designated the treatment and control groups differently, making it difficult to compare the findings across the studies. Generally speaking, the balance of evidence from the studies of WAWS suggests that the less-stringent work search requirements, as implemented in the group known as exception-reporting or no work test, depending on the study, led to lower short-term employment and higher short-term UI benefit receipt duration, total amount, and likelihood of exhausting benefits than standard or slightly modified work-search requirements. The long-term employment and short- and long-term earnings of claimants subject to the less-stringent work search requirements were no better or worse than those of the groups subject to more-stringent work search requirements.","",""

The study used a nonexperimental design to assess the program’s impact. With data collected from a national survey, the authors compared the proportion of children that participated in work between those who received financial educational support in the past year before taking the survey, and matched comparison groups of children who had not received financial educational study.
The study found that receipt of educational assistance was significantly associated with lower rates of child labor.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not ensure that the groups being compared were similar before the intervention. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to BSM; other factors are likely to have contributed.","Absence of conflict of interest.","The program, Cash Transfer for the Poor Students Programme or Bantuan Siswa Miskin (BSM), began in 2008 to provide households with financial support for children’s education. It was implemented in Indonesia by the local government, and aimed to improve educational participation and attainment in low-income students from elementary to university level by encouraging household investment in educational expenses and reducing child participation in work. Households received cash transfer funds at the beginning of each school year to cover school-related costs. The selection of participants was limited by the amount of available funds, and was determined by school administrators. However, there was not clear or consistent criteria for selecting households into the program.","The study was a nonexperimental design where the authors used propensity score matching to create comparison groups that did not receive any cash transfers or scholarships for schooling. The study included children 6-18 years old, however, the child labor outcome analyses only included those aged 10-14. Demographic and child work outcomes were measured with the 2009 iteration of the nationally representative household survey, called the Indonesia Social and Economic Survey (Susenas). The Susenas survey collected data on different topics including child labor and demographics. There was a survey question that asked whether children had received educational support in the past year; if they received educational support then the authors placed them into the treatment group, and if they did not they were placed into the initial comparison group. The authors then used the initial comparison group to create a matched comparison group that was similar in demographics to the treatment group. The propensity score matching and impact analyses were conducted separately for each of five wealth quintiles (from the lowest to the highest). Using six comparison groups formed through propensity score algorithms, the authors assessed the difference in the rate of participation in work activities between the treatment and comparison groups, controlling for demographic differences, such as child age and gender.","Employment/Child labor
The study found that receipt of educational assistance was significantly associated with lower rates of child labor for two of the five wealth quintiles (the lowest fifth of wealth and the second lower fifth of wealth). For the higher three wealth quintiles, there was no significant relationship between receipt of educational assistance and rates of child labor.","The authors did not account for preexisting differences between the groups before program participation, such as initial participation in child labor. The preexisting differences between the groups—and not the program— could explain the observed differences in outcomes.","",""

The study used a nonexperimental design to compare the outcomes of children who received the cash transfer to those who did not. Outcomes were measured using baseline and follow-up household surveys and analyzed using regression.
The study found that the number of days that girls were engaged in household business (non-farm activities) significantly decreased in Abi Adi; no significant impacts were found for boys in Abi Adi or any children in the Hintalo Wajirat. The study also found that the rates of school enrollment significantly increased for girls aged 6-11 in Hintalo Wajirat; there were no significant impacts for boys in Hintalo Wajirat or any children in Abi Adi.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it was based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the conditional cash transfer program and not to other factors.","Absence of conflict of interest.","The Social Cash Transfer Pilot Program (SCTPP) was introduced in 2011 to alleviate poverty and improve the quality of life for vulnerable children, older persons, and persons with disabilities. Households were selected for the program if they were extremely poor and labor constrained (i.e., elderly head of household with no working adults aged 19-60, one adult is responsible for three dependent members, or contains a chronically ill or disabled adult). Eligibility was initially determined by Community Care Coalitions (CCCs) and neighborhood (tabia) authorities. Two CCC members visited the households and ranked them from most to least needy. A community meeting was held to review the list. Social workers from the district (woreda) then made a final visit to verify eligibility. Households received monthly payments of 25 birr for each child under 16 years of age plus an additional 10 birr if the child is enrolled in school; payments were made for up to four children. An additional payment was provided if the household contained a disabled child under 18 years of age (40 birr), a disabled adult (50 birr), or an elderly dependent (60 birr). The minimum payment amount each month was 155 birr (approximately $8 USD).","The study was a nonexperimental design conducted in two districts, the town of Abi Adi and a rural area, Hintalo Wajirat. In Abi Adi, all neighborhoods were included. In Hintalo Wajirat, 7 of the 22 neighborhoods were initially included. Another neighborhood, Bahr Tseba, was added eight months after the program started when additional funding was secured. Neighborhoods were purposefully selected based on proximity to the highway to make program implementation easier and reduce administrative costs. Within Abi Adi, all smaller regions were included. In Hintalo Wajirat, three were excluded due to geography (e.g., rugged terrain, lack of roads, etc.).
The authors created three groups: 1) a treatment group selected from households that received SCTPP benefits, 2) a control group comprising households that were eligible for SCTPP benefits, but were not enrolled primarily due to lack of funds, and 3) a random sample of households that did not meet eligibility criteria. The primary reason for the random sample was so that the authors could determine how accurately eligible households were targeted, and to identify any larger trends in the neighborhoods or districts included in the study. However, the random sample was not used in impact analyses. There were 1,696 households in the treatment group, 1,539 households in the comparison, and 432 households in the randomly selected group. The authors oversampled non-elderly households in the treatment group to ensure that a sufficient number of children were included in the sample.
The first household survey was conducted between May and June of 2012 and included 3,667 households. The follow-up household survey was conducted between May and July of 2014 and included 3,351 households. Child labor outcomes included the number of days spent in wage labor and household business labor (nonfarm); school enrollment was measured as enrollment at any time in the school year. Impacts were assessed using regression and disaggregated by district (Hintalo Wajirat or Abi Adi), age (6-11 or 12-16), and gender.","Employment/Child labor
The study found that the number of days that girls were engaged in work in household businesses (non-farm activities) significantly decreased in Abi Adi by one day. There was no significant impact on boys in Abi Adi, or on boys or girls in Hintalo Wajirat.
Education (School participation/enrollment)
The study found that school enrollment of girls aged 6-11 in Hintalo Wajirat significantly increased by 13.3 percentage points. There was no significant impact on older girls (aged 12-16) or boys in Hintalo Wajirat, or on boys or girls in Abi Adi.","The first survey occurred eight months after the SCTPP started, so it was not a true baseline survey. During the first household survey, the authors included several recall questions for key outcomes that asked respondents to go back 12 months to May 2011 before the program/payments began. They then used single difference models for data analysis when appropriate.","",""

In a nonexperimental analysis, the author compared average employment rates and earnings for people who received OST or OJT to those who did not receive either employment service. Employment and earnings data came from payroll tax records.
The study found that individuals participating in OST or OJT were more likely to be employed and had higher earnings in the first and third quarters after exiting the program.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the author did not ensure that the groups being compared were similar before program participation. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the WIA employment training programs; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The intervention involved participation in one of two WIA employment training programs: OST or OJT. OST builds skills for specific occupations and includes participating in seminars, certification programs, or degree programs. OJT usually requires an individual’s placement on a job site for 480 hours of temporary employment; the firm can then choose to hire the employee. Job seekers who registered for employment services at a South Dakota local office system (SDLOS) from January 2002 to December 2011, were ages 20 to 65 at registration, and had earned no higher than a bachelor’s degree were eligible for services. After several meetings with the job seeker, SDLOS recommended OST, OJT, or other services including career counseling and interview coaching.","In a nonexperimental analysis, the author compared the outcomes of individuals who received OST or OJT to those who did not receive either. Of the 6,322 eligible cases, 2,263 received OST, 344 received OJT, and 3,715 received neither OST nor OJT (but may have received other services). The author used quarterly data from payroll tax records to establish employment status (at the beginning of each quarter) and earnings (across the entire quarter) for the first and third quarters after exiting the SDLOS program.","Employment. The study found that individuals participating in the WIA OST or OJT employment training programs were significantly more likely than individuals who did not participate to be employed in the first quarter after exiting the training program by 3 percentage points for OST and 9 percentage points for OJT. Individuals participating in OST or OJT were significantly more likely to be employed in the third quarter after exiting the training program by 3 and 7 percentage points, respectively.
Earnings. Individuals participating in OST or OJT had significantly higher earnings in the first quarter after exiting the training program by $505 and $819, respectively. Individuals participating in OST or OJT had significantly higher earnings in the third quarter after exiting the training program by $708 and $567, respectively.","The author showed that OST and OJT participants were similar to the comparison group in terms of employment status and earnings for two quarters before the program, except that OST participants had lower earnings than the comparison group. However, because earnings of workers receiving employment services tend to dip in the year before they enter the program, it is necessary to show that program and comparison groups are similar on pre-program measures for more than one year before program entry to ensure that existing trends in outcomes will not lead to incorrect conclusions about program effectiveness.","",""

This summary focuses on the comparison between the Honest Money Box program group and the control group.
The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted in three districts in southern Ghana. Schools in each district were randomly assigned into one of two treatment groups and a control group. Survey data were collected at baseline and at the end of the school year. Data were analyzed using regression.
The study did not find any statistically significant effects on child labor or school attendance for children participating in the Honest Money Box program.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial with low attrition. This means we would be confident that any estimated effects would be attributable to the Honest Money Box program and not to other factors. However, the study did not find statistically significant effects.","Absence of conflict of interest.","Honest Money Box (HMB) is a financial literacy program created for the study by Ask Mama Development Organization and Innovations for Poverty Actions staff. It was modeled on the Aflatoun program. Aflatoun is an international non-governmental organization (NGO) that developed a school-based curriculum for financial literacy, which has been adapted and implemented in over 100 countries. The program covers topics such as the importance of money, saving and spending, planning and budgeting, and entrepreneurship. While financial literacy programs aimed at children are common, the authors note that encouraging children to think about money and financial literacy can lead them to prioritize work activities at the expense of school. Thus, the Aflatoun program includes components on 1) character and motto, 2) personal understanding and exploration, and 3) rights and responsibilities. These rights and responsibilities include the rights described in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which entitles children to protection from exploitation, including work that is harmful or takes them away from their education.
Honest Money Box only included the financial components of the Aflatoun program—focusing on financial literacy and saving money. The HMB program required about eight hours to administer. The curriculum was broken down into one-hour after-school sessions that were conducted by teachers during student club time.
Honest Money Box was school-based and, for this study, included children in primary (grades 1-6) and junior high (grades 7 and 8) schools. Schools received a metal padlocked savings box used to collect and store children’s money. Either a teacher or student club officer recorded activities in a ledger and in the student’s passbook. After the curriculum was taught, the club continued to operate as a savings club where children could deposit or withdraw their savings. The Honest Money Box program contracted with the Netherlands Development organization, who subcontracted with the Women and Development Project, the Ask Mama Development Organization, Berea Social Foundation, and Support for Community Mobilization. These organizations coordinated with the Ghana Education service, a government agency.","Eligible schools were those that served the same students in the morning and afternoon, so that an after-school program could effectively be implemented. From a list of 165 eligible schools, 135 were randomly selected for the evaluation. The chosen schools were in three southern Ghana districts: Nkwanta (n=36), Greater Accra East (n=30), and Sekondi Takoradi Metropolitan Area (n=69). Of the 135 schools, 45 were randomly assigned to receive Aflatoun (addressed in a separate profile), 45 to receive the Honest Money Box program, and 45 were assigned to the control group.
Across the whole study, researchers wanted to survey 40 children in each school, targeting students in grades 5 and 7 because they would have greater access to money than younger children and, importantly, would be in the same school the following year. However, if the school did not contain enough children in a grade, the researchers selected children from adjacent grades. This produced a sample that was 45 percent grade 5, 46 percent grade 7, and 9 percent from adjacent grades.
The study authors created a work index comprised of 11 variables (worked in past 4 months to earn money, days worked in past 30 days, amount of money earned working in past 30 days, amount of money earned working in past 30 days standardized, worked in February, worked in March, worked in April, worked in May, worked inside the household, worked outside the household, and worked “a lot” during school term). Another index, Academic Performance, contains two variables (self-reported days of school attended last week and a standardized aptitude test score).
Baseline survey data were collected in September 2010. The intervention began in October and lasted through the end of the school year in July 2011, when follow-up survey data were collected. The authors used ordinary least squares regression to evaluate the program’s effect on labor and school attendance for children. A total of 5,291 cases were analyzed.","Employment/Child labor
There was no significant impact of the Honest Money Box program on the 11-variable work index, even when each variable comprising the index was individually analyzed.

The study authors intended to survey 40 students from each school, for a total of 5,400 students.

The purpose was to provide a wide range of job services and industry-specific training to both unemployed jobseekers and employed workers looking to advance their careers. The initiative launched three centers: the Transportation Career Center, the Healthcare Career Center, and the Manufacturing Career Center. The three sector-focused programs targeted different populations and provided services and trainings tailored to the specific industry. Specifically, the sector-focused programs used a strategy that helped businesses within a specific economic sector meet their needs for highly skilled workers and sought to provide higher-wage jobs with career potential to low-income people.","The authors created propensity scores from data on demographic characteristics and work and earnings history to match 13,102 participants in New York City sector-focused career centers to 13,102 people served by New York City career centers without a specific sector.

Specific factors examined were programming and/or video-gaming experience; support from peers, instructors, mentors, and family members; and level and type of motivation to pursue a CIS degree.
The authors administered a series of three (baseline and 6- and 18-month follow-up) surveys to students enrolled in an introductory programming class at one of 15 California community colleges and ran multiple linear regression models by gender to determine each of the three factors’ influence on the student’s plan to pursue a four-year CIS degree, comparing results for women versus men.
The study found that female students, who were overall less likely to intend to pursue a four-year CIS degree, reported receiving significantly less encouragement from their peers to persist in computer science and spending less time playing computer games than male students. Predictors for women choosing to pursue a four-year CIS degree changed over time: strong immediate (baseline) predictors were interest in computer science, video gaming, and peer encouragement; a year after baseline, the strongest predictors were expectations for success and interest in solving problems.","","","","","","",""

Using data from the U.S. Department of Education’s Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), the authors calculated the ratio of women to men earning doctoral degrees by field, controlling for the number who completed an undergraduate degree in the same field (called “prepared” students).
The study found that, overall, men are overrepresented in 76 percent of doctoral fields. This means that, after controlling for the number of students who complete an undergraduate degree in a given field, more men than women are completing doctoral degrees in the same field. However, there is slightly less gender imbalance of prepared students earning doctoral degrees in all STEM fields than in non-STEM fields, even though the absolute number of men receiving STEM doctoral degrees is higher.
The authors suggest that because female undergraduate STEM majors persist from undergraduate to graduate levels at almost the same rate (90 percent as often) as men, gender imbalance must be addressed earlier in the academic pipeline to address overall disparities in the receipt of STEM doctoral degrees.","","","","","","",""

The study found that receipt of the cash transfer was significantly associated with an increase in school enrollment. However, receipt of the transfer was also associated with significantly higher rates of work.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not ensure that the groups being compared were similar before the intervention. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to Bolsa Familia program; other factors are likely to have contributed."," Absence of conflict of interest.","Established in 2003, the Bolsa Familia program is a conditional cash transfer program aimed to increase human capital among impoverished households. Families were eligible to receive Bolsa Familia if they had monthly household per capita earnings below 70 Reais (Brazilian currency) or if they had a monthly household per capital income between 70.01 and 140 Reais and had children 17 and under residing in the household. Participating households must follow certain conditions to receive the financial benefit including attending nutritional and parental counseling sessions, getting the children vaccinated, and enrolling children in school.","The authors implemented a nonexperimental design to examine whether there were differences in child labor and school enrollment between those individuals who received the Bolsa Familia benefit and those who did not. The data were drawn from the 2010 Brazilian Demographic Census, which is administered by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. The study included households with children aged 7 to 14 years. The treatment and comparison groups were formed by selecting households that received the Bolsa Familia benefit for the treatment group, and selecting households that did not receive the benefit for the comparison group. This was determined by one question on the Census. It asked whether or not the household received Bolsa Familia benefits. The question also asked if households received benefits from a different program to eradicate child labor (Programa de Erradicação do Trabalho Infantil – PETI). Households with an income up to 140 Brazilian Reais were eligible for Bolsa Familia; those with an income above 140 Braziliam Reais with a child engaged in work were eligible for PETI. The authors attempted to control for this by disaggregating by household income. The authors examined these differences across three economic groups, which was determined by creating cut-offs based on the maximum threshold of per capita household income of below 1) 70 Brazilian Reais, 2) 140 Brazilian Reais, and 3) 280 Brazilian Reais. The outcomes included whether or not the child worked and whether or not the child was enrolled in school. Analyses included means tests and logistic regression with controls for household and child characteristics.","Employment/Child labor 
Participation in Bolsa Familia was associated with significantly higher rates of work when compared to comparison group households across the three income levels. Children in households receiving the Bolsa Familia were 10 to 17 percent more likely to work compared to children in the comparison households.
Education (School participation/enrollment)
The study found that receipt of the Bolsa Familia benefit was significantly related to higher rates of school enrollment across the three income levels. Children in households receiving the Bolsa Familia were twice as likely to be enrolled in school compared to children in the comparison households.","The study used data from the Brazilian Census to identify children who received the program. The question asked if the household received benefits from two conditional cash transfers, Bolsa Familia or PETI. Therefore, it is unclear if the Bolsa Familia program was impacting the child labor and school enrollment outcomes.
The authors used a nonexperimental design and controlled for age, gender, and mother's education in the regression models. However, the authors did not account for the outcomes at baseline, such as previous school attendance or child labor.

The study used establishment transitions between federal contractor and non-contractor status to pinpoint the effects of affirmative action regulation using multiple regression analysis. The author based his analysis on EEO-1 Employer Information Report files from 1978–2004.
The study found that federal contractors subject to the affirmative action Executive Order increased African American employment share by 0.13–0.15 percentage points each year relative to non-contractors not subject to the Order.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it was based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to affirmative action requirements under Executive Order 11246, but other factors might also have contributed.","","Affirmative action Executive Order 11246, signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965, reinforced prohibitions in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and earlier executive orders against discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin; subsequent Orders and revisions have added sex (1967) and sexual orientation and gender identity (2014) as protected classes. Order 11246 required the federal government and federal contractors with 50 or more employees or $50,000 in contracts to develop written affirmative action plans and ensure equal opportunities for all workers. The Order authorized the Secretary of Labor to establish the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs to enforce federal contractors’ compliance.","The analysis used data from EEO-1 Employer Information Report files from 1978–2004. These are establishment-level data from annual workforce surveys that employers meeting certain size requirements must submit to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. Before 1982, all private employers with at least 50 employees and federal contractors with at least 25 employees were required to file EEO-1 reports; since then, the size requirements for EEO-1 filing have risen to 100 employees for private employers and 50 employees for federal contractors. The sample included establishments in 204 U.S. metropolitan areas where the African American share of the working population was at least 5 percent at some point during the analysis period. Depending on the specific analysis, the number of federal contractor establishments in the sample ranged from 2,530 to 6,066.
The author examined transitions into and out of federal contractor status to pinpoint the initial effects of regulation under affirmative action and their persistence over time. The study estimated difference-in-differences regression models that compared yearly changes in African American employment share at federal contractors before and after they became contractors (or before and after they stopped being contractors) with changes at establishments that never became contractors from 1978 to 2004. The models controlled for establishment size, the number of years before and after the establishment became a contractor, fixed establishment effects, and fixed annual U.S. Census geographic region effects.","The African American employment share at federal contractors subject to the affirmative action Executive Order 11246 increased significantly more each year by 0.13–0.15 percentage points relative to the share at non-contractors not subject to the Order.
Statistically significant gains in the African American employment share persisted even after establishments transitioned out of federal contractor status.","Because establishments choose to become federal contractors, those who find the affirmative action regulations easier to comply with could be more likely to become or continue to be federal contractors. The author addressed this issue by including controls for fixed and time-varying differences between contractors and non-contractors. The author also confirmed that between establishments that do and do not ultimately become federal contractors, there is no significant difference in the share of African American employees before becoming a federal contractor.","",""

The authors reported that the percentage of quarters employed for those who took part in an apprenticeship program significantly increased by 7.8 percentage points more in the third quarter after program exit compared to those who registered for services at the Labor Exchange; the percentage of quarters employed for the apprenticeship group increased by 9.8 percentage points more in quarters 9–12 after program exit compared to the Labor Exchange group. The average number of hours worked per quarter also increased significantly more for those who took part in an apprenticeship program; the average hours worked per quarter by the treatment group increased by 53.7 more in the third quarter after program exit and increased by 50.9 more in quarters 9–12 after program exit than the comparison group.
Earnings. The authors reported that average earnings per quarter significantly increased by $3,243 more in the third quarter after program exit and by $3,511 more in quarters 9–12 after program exit for those who took part in an apprenticeship program compared to those who registered at the Labor Exchange. Average hourly wages significantly increased by more for the treatment group than the comparison group, both in the third quarter after program exit and in quarters 9–12 after program exit (by $6.03 and $7.27, respectively).
Public benefit receipt. The authors found that, compared to those who registered for services at the Labor Exchange, the likelihood of benefit receipt significantly increased by 5.6 percentage points more in quarters 9–12 after program exit for those who took part in an apprenticeship program, with claimants receiving a significant average increase in wages of $74 more than the comparison group.","Although the authors accounted for many underlying characteristics of the groups being compared, which could also influence their outcomes, the authors’ decision to define the groups based on their date of program exit rather than program entry is problematic. For example, suppose that the apprenticeship program and Labor Exchange participants were on identical wage trajectories before receiving services from their respective programs, and suppose that the average length of participation in the apprenticeship program was six months, whereas that for Labor Exchange was one month. At the conclusion of participation, they exited the program.
If we compared the groups’ earnings 6 months after their recorded exit dates, we would see apprenticeship program participants’ earnings about 12 months after they started receiving services and Labor Exchange participants’ earnings about 7 months after they started receiving services. If both programs were completely ineffective and everyone stayed on their original upward-sloping wage trajectory, it would appear as though the apprenticeship program participants earned more 6 months after their exit dates. However, this would not be attributable to receiving apprenticeship program services; it would be caused by the difference in elapsed time across the groups (12 months for apprenticeship program participants versus 7 months for Labor Exchange participants). Therefore, studies defining the groups based on exit date instead of entry date cannot receive a moderate causal evidence rating.","",""

The authors compared rates of exit from unemployment in groups of claimants who entered UI before and after the reform’s implementation in November 2005. The authors used social security and UI data from Hungary’s Institute of Economics and National Employment Service.
The study found support for the behavioral job search model and theorized that approximately budget-neutral transitions to two-step UI systems could speed claimants’ exit out of unemployment.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because it cannot account for factors other than the UI program that also changed over the period of study and could also have influenced the outcomes of interest. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to Hungary’s 2005 UI reform; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Before 2005, Hungary’s UI system had two tiers. In the first tier, benefit duration depended on a worker’s previous contributions to social security, with a maximum duration of 270 days, and benefit amount depended on earnings in the previous year. After reaching their maximum duration, claimants who remained unemployed became eligible for Unemployment Assistance, which provided the same benefits to everyone regardless of past earnings.
On November 1, 2005, Hungary introduced a reformed, two-step UI system. In the first step, which lasted for half the maximum first-tier duration, or at most 90 days, benefit amounts were calculated based on the claimant’s previous earnings, with a lower replacement rate than under the previous system (60 percent instead of 65 percent), but substantially higher minimum and maximum benefit amounts than the previous system. In the second step (days 91 to 270), every claimant received the same benefit amount regardless of previous earnings. The total UI duration for each claimant and eligibility for Unemployment Assistance remained the same. The authors noted that for those with high pre-UI earnings, the overall payout under both systems would be approximately the same because lower benefits in step two (days 91-270) offset higher benefits in step one (days 1-90).","The authors proposed a “reference-dependent” model of job search where a reference point is given by consumption in the recent past and workers are loss-averse with respect to payoffs below the reference point. So, for a newly unemployed worker, the reference point would be recent earnings before becoming unemployed. Because the UI benefits are substantially below previous earnings, the worker finds this painful and tries hard to find a new job. As time goes on and the worker remains unemployed, he becomes accustomed to the lower UI benefits, and job search effort decreases. However, as the exhaustion of UI benefits approaches, the worker anticipates the even lower benefit amount he will receive, and resumes diligently job searching.
To test this theory, the authors compared the outcomes of a group of UI claimants who entered the system between February and October 2005, before the reform’s implementation in November 2005, to those of a group of claimants who entered the system between February and October 2006, after the reform went into effect. If the theory were supported, the exit rate from unemployment should be higher around the 270-day exhaustion date for workers under the pre-reform system than for workers in the post-reform system because they faced a much steeper decline in benefits upon UI exhaustion. Measuring time as days since UI entry, the authors calculated the reform’s impact on the probability of exit from UI separately in each two-week time period as the difference in probability of exit between members of the pre- and post-reform groups, controlling for characteristics such as age, gender, years of education, and previous earnings.","The study found support for the reference-dependent model of job search. Rates of exit from UI were higher in the period immediately preceding the exhaustion of regular benefits and transition to Unemployment Assistance for workers receiving UI pre-reform compared with those receiving UI post-reform. The authors claim this is consistent with the higher anticipated loss in consumption for workers receiving UI pre-reform.","The authors compared reemployment trends among UI claimants before the UI reform took place to reemployment trends among claimants after the reform took place. Even including controls for the demographic characteristics and earnings histories of the two groups, there remains a strong possibility that other changes in the economy and the UI system that could have influenced reemployment rates were simultaneously taking place. Because the study does not include a comparison group of unaffected individuals, it is not possible to attribute the observed differences in outcomes to the reforms alone.","",""

YTD projects provided services to help youth with disabilities improve their education and employment outcomes and become more economically self-sufficient.
Data were collected from the Master Earnings File (MEF), Supplemental Security Record (SSR), Master Beneficiary Record (MBR), and Numerical Identification System (Numident) file. The authors estimated program impacts on measures of paid employment and Social Security disability benefit receipt.
The study found that, in three of the sites examined, YTD participants were more likely to have at least some earnings in the first calendar years after random assignment; this was also the case for three sites in the second calendar year after random assignment. However, YTD had no statistically significant impacts on average earnings during either calendar year. In four of the six sites, YTD participants were more likely to receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) 24 months after random assignment.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this report is high because it is based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we can be confident that the estimated impacts are attributable to YTD, and not other factors.","Absence of conflict of interest: This study was conducted by staff from Mathematica Policy Research, which administers CLEAR. Therefore, the review of this study was conducted by an independent consultant trained in applying the CLEAR causal evidence guidelines.","Sponsored by the Social Security Administration (SSA), the YTD projects were intended to help youth ages 14 to 25 with disabilities who received or were at risk of receiving Social Security disability benefits become more economically self-sufficient and improve their employment outcomes. Interventions and target populations varied across sites, but those assigned to the YTD treatment groups were offered some combination of benefits counseling, career counseling, and coordination of services, as well as internships, job shadowing, job coaching, competitive paid employment, and empowerment training.
All YTD participants were also eligible for waivers that (1) extended the Student Earned Income Exclusion to all YTD participants, regardless of age, who attended school; (2) increased the Earned Income Exclusion to a $1 reduction in SSI benefit for every $4 earned above a base amount; and (3) delayed benefit cessation for YTD participants who were determined ineligible for benefits after a continuing disability review or age-18 SSI medical redetermination.","Six YTD sites were evaluated using a randomized controlled trial at each site. The analysis reported in this study relied exclusively on SSA administrative data, although interim reports also relied on survey data. Evaluation data sources included the MEF for annual earnings data; the SSR and MBR for SSI and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program participation information, respectively; and the Numident file for dates of death. The author estimated the impacts on paid employment, earnings, and Social Security disability benefit receipt.","In three of the six sites (Bronx, NY; FL; WV) YTD participants were 6 to 25 percentage points more likely to have any earnings in the first full calendar year post random assignment.
In three of the six sites (Bronx, NY; CO; WV) YTD participants were 6 to 10 percentage points more likely to have any earnings in the second full calendar year post random assignment.
In four of the six sites (Bronx, NY; Erie, NY; FL; WV) YTD participants were 6 to 12 percentage points more likely to receive SSI and 6 to 11 percentage points more likely to receive either SSI or SSDI two years after random assignment.
None of the sites had statistically significant impacts on paid employment or average earnings during either the first or second full calendar year after random assignment.","Because the MEF reports earnings by calendar year, employment and earnings impacts could not be estimated for the months in the calendar year of random assignment.
The study authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes of interest separately for each of six sites. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness.

The authors considered all students who elected to participate in the program and attended all but two of the workshops during the first quarter to be in the treatment group. All students who did not join the GSW group or who missed more than two workshops were considered the comparison group. Overall, there were 4,055 treatment and 15,989 comparison students. School administrative data provided students’ course grades. The authors estimated regression models comparing the outcomes of treatment and comparison group members, controlling for gender and race.","The study found no significant relationships between GSW program participation and students’ grades when modeling outcomes separately by gender.","The authors did not establish the comparability of students in the treatment and comparison groups, so the estimated impact of the GSW program might reflect the effect of other factors in addition to the effect of the intervention. Although the authors stated that they estimated their regression models controlling for prior academic achievement, they did not present these findings in the report. Instead, they reported results from regression models that controlled only for gender and race. In addition, study participants chose whether to participate in the intervention, so there could have been unobservable differences (for example, in levels of motivation) between students who chose to participate in the GSW program and those who did not. Therefore, the estimated impacts might reflect differences in unobservable characteristics rather than the true impact of the program itself.","",""

The authors estimated regression models comparing employment outcomes for youth who participated in career tech with those who did not, while controlling for differences in demographic characteristics.
The study found that career tech participants were 0.235 times more likely than those in the comparison group to be employed when leaving high school. Career tech participants were also 0.064 times more likely to be employed at any point within the first year after high school (0.066 times for those who were unemployed upon leaving high school). These findings were statistically significant.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the study did not control for students’ degree of disadvantage. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to career tech participation; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Students who participated in a career tech program had career and/or technical education included as part of their individualized education programs (IEPs) in high school. Career tech, although it could have been implemented slightly differently across the 23 study school districts, generally provided students with core academic, employability, and job-specific skills. Students had to participate in career tech for at least one semester to be considered part of the treatment group.","The study implemented a nonexperimental analysis of the employment of 500 former high school students with a specific learning or intellectual disability who lived in relatively high-poverty areas. Career tech participation and employment data were collected in a 12-month post-high school survey. The analysis compared employment outcomes for those who participated in career tech and those who did not, controlling for differences in the demographic characteristics of the study participants.","The study found that students who had participated in career tech were 6.4 percentage points more likely to have been employed at any point within the first year after leaving high school, compared with students who had not participated in career tech. The difference was statistically significant.
The likelihood of being employed when leaving high school was 23.5 percentage points higher for those who had participated in career tech than for those who had not, a statistically significant finding.
Among students who were unemployed upon leaving high school, those who had participated in career tech were 6.6 percentage points more likely to be employed at any point within the first year after leaving high school compared with those who did not participate, a statistically significant finding.","The authors did not establish that the treatment and comparison groups were comparable before the career tech intervention. The groups could have differed for several reasons. First, although all students lived in relatively high-poverty areas, there might have been differences between the groups in terms of degree of disadvantage, and the analysis did not control for such differences. Second, most, but not all, study schools offered a career tech program. Thus, the groups might have differed in terms of the schools they attended. The study’s geographic control variable did not adequately control for this issue. Finally, students’ decisions to participate in career tech could have been related to their levels of socioeconomic disadvantage. For example, students of parents with higher levels of education might have placed stronger emphasis on pursuing a college degree, making them less likely to take part in the career tech program. The impact estimates could thus reflect differences in outcomes between the treatment and comparison groups that were due to differences in these factors as well as the effects of the career tech program.
In addition, data on career tech participation came from individual responses to a survey conducted one year after high school graduation, rather than from school administrative records. Such data might have had problems with misreporting, which could have affected the precision or accuracy of the impact estimates.","",""

About 2,000 eligible people were randomly assigned to participate in the ABD. Evaluation data sources included a baseline telephone interview, a 12-month follow-up survey, the Master Beneficiary Record data file, the Summary Earnings Record data file, and Ticket to Work SSA administrative records. The authors estimated the impacts on earnings and employment outcomes for each of three years following enrollment.
The study found positive impacts on employment and earnings for those receiving ABD telephonic services.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is high because it is a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means that we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the intervention and not to other factors.","","Almost all new SSDI recipients must wait 24 months after their SSDI eligibility date to be eligible for Medicare benefits. Some SSDI recipients have no health insurance during this Medicare waiting period. The ABD provided health insurance to new, uninsured SSDI recipients (that is, no concurrent SSI/SSDI recipients), ages 18 to 54, who had at least 18 months to wait before Medicare eligibility.
For the demonstration, 1,997 volunteers living in 53 qualifying U.S. metropolitan areas were randomly assigned to receive either accelerated benefits (AB), AB Plus, or no additional services (that is, control). Both AB and AB Plus members received immediate health insurance with greater benefit coverage, lower copayments, and a more comprehensive provider network than Medicare. AB Plus members were also eligible for three voluntary services delivered by telephone: a behavioral health motivation program, employment and public assistance benefits counseling, and medical case management. The report’s analysis sample includes 1,531 people randomly assigned to one of the three experimental groups on or before November 6, 2008, because after that date random assignment into AB Plus was ended due to budgetary pressures.","Data were collected from a wide range of sources, including a baseline telephone interview, a 12-month follow-up survey, the Master Beneficiary Record data file, the Summary Earnings Record data file, and Ticket to Work SSA administrative records. The authors estimated the impacts of AB Plus compared with the control group; AB Plus compared with AB only; and AB only compared with the control group. Outcomes of interest included any employment and average annual earnings in each of the first three years following random assignment.","Compared with the control group, AB Plus resulted in a 5.3 percentage point increase in those with any earnings two years after random assignment. In addition, it resulted in a $576 increase in average annual earnings one year after random assignment and $831 two years after random assignment, though these differences were no longer statistically significant by the third year after random assignment.
Compared with the AB-only group, AB Plus resulted in a 5.6 percentage point increase in those with any earnings two years after random assignment. In addition, it resulted in an increase in average annual earnings of $736 in the first year and $1,024 in the second year after random assignment, though these differences were no longer statistically significant by the third year after random assignment.
There were no statistically significant differences in employment or earnings over any follow-up period between the AB-only and control groups.","Because the ABD was targeted to SSDI recipients most likely to benefit from accelerated benefits and services, the findings are generalizable only to the subset of SSDI recipients eligible to participate: those ages 18 to 54 without health insurance. In addition, provisions of the Affordable Care Act, which was passed after the ABD concluded, might have decreased the proportion of SSDI recipients who were uninsured during the Medicare waiting period. This would further limit the study’s generalizability.
The study authors estimated multiple related impacts on employment and earnings. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings from the study is likely to be overstated.","",""

Evidence from New York City","The study’s objective was to examine the impact of New York City (NYC) STEM high schools on math and science test-taking behavior and scores.
The study used regression analyses to compare outcomes for students who attended a STEM-focused high school with those who attended a regular public high school. The study used administrative data from the NYC Department of Education.
The study found that young women attending STEM high schools in NYC were more likely to take various New York State Regents Examinations in math and science and to score higher on biology tests compared with young women who attended non-STEM public high schools.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is low because the treatment and comparison groups were not equivalent on key measures at baseline. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to STEM high schools; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","STEM high schools in NYC teach specific science and math programs to every student. Admission to these schools is based on a number of criteria, including student preference, school-specific admission criteria, and space availability. In addition to offering this specialized curriculum, STEM high schools employ different teachers than do the regular public high schools—on average, NYC STEM teachers have more experience teaching and are more likely to have earned a master’s degree than their counterparts at regular public high schools. Teachers at these schools also earn higher salaries than those in the traditional public schools. Because the study cannot disentangle the effects of the STEM programs themselves and the different teacher characteristics, this review considers STEM teachers to be a component of the treatment condition as implemented in this study.","The study used data from high schools in the NYC public school system, which included 30 STEM schools. There were 181 non-STEM schools in 2007 and 227 in 2008 included as comparisons. The authors used regression analyses to compare STEM with non-STEM schools on both the probability of taking New York State Regents Examinations in various subjects (Math A, Math B, Chemistry, Physics, and Biology) as well as the scores received on those tests. Students in New York must pass a series of five tests in order to earn a Regents high school diploma, including at least one math and one science exam, or can earn an Advanced diploma by passing additional exams (a non-Regents diploma can be earned by passing any one exam). The analyses controlled for middle school scores in math and reading, race and ethnicity, free lunch eligibility, English language use at home, limited English proficiency, and age. The authors ran regression models by gender to estimate gender gaps both within and across school types.","The study found that female students in NYC STEM schools were significantly more likely to take Math B, Chemistry, and Physics Regents exams and to earn higher scores on the Biology exam compared with female students in non-STEM schools.","Students in NYC chose whether to attend a STEM or non-STEM school. The authors were unable to control for unobservable differences between the two types of students, including potential selection factors such as parental support and student motivation, that might influence a student’s decision regarding which type of school to attend. Thus, estimated effects might reflect differences in outcomes that are due to these differences in student characteristics as well as the impact of the STEM school.
The study measured the effectiveness of STEM high schools in NYC. The results might not be externally valid in other cities, particularly if other STEM schools do not share the same characteristics as the NYC STEM schools, including offering higher teacher salaries and hiring more educated and experienced teachers.","",""

Using surveys developed for the study, the authors compared the outcomes of students before and after participating in the PGSS program.
The study found that female students had a significantly improved disposition toward technology and general science and a significantly higher interest in the specific fields of chemistry, computer science, and math at the end of the program, compared to the start of the program.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not observe outcomes for multiple periods before the intervention nor account for selection into the intervention. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the PGSS program; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The PGSS program is a five-week program held at Carnegie Mellon University for students in the summer before their senior year of high school. Five days a week, students take core classes in biology, chemistry, computer science, math, and physics; complete lab requirements; and work collaboratively with other students on projects and homework assignments. Courses cover college-level content, and the program emphasizes collaboration among classmates. No classes are held on weekends; students typically use their time for social activities and homework. Students successfully completing the program receive a personalized letter of recommendation from faculty and teaching assistants. The study examined the program during summer 2013, during which 30 female and 30 male students participated.","The authors compared the outcomes of students before and after participating in the PGSS program. Using a survey developed for the study, the authors collected information on students’ attitudes toward and interest in STEM on the first day of the program and again during the last week. Results were presented separately for boys and girls.","The study found that female students gave technology and general science a more favorable rating at the end of the program than at the beginning of the program.
Female students had a statistically significantly higher interest in the specific fields of chemistry, computer science, and math at the end of the program, compared to their stated interest at the start of the program.","The authors compared the outcomes of participants measured once before and once after they participated in the PGSS program. CLEAR’s guidelines require that the authors observe outcomes for multiple periods before the intervention to rule out the possibility that participants had increasing or decreasing trends in the outcomes examined before enrollment in the program. That is, if participants who had increasing interest in and disposition toward STEM fields tended to enroll in the program, we would anticipate further improvements in their attitudes toward STEM over time, even if they did not participate in the program. Without knowing the trends before program enrollment, we cannot rule this out.
Further, CLEAR’s guidelines require that the authors demonstrate that participants would not have selected into the intervention based on pre-intervention trends in the outcomes and/or their own characteristics. Because PGSS participants comprise only those students who applied for and were admitted to the program, they are likely different from eligible students who were not admitted or did not apply. It is possible that the characteristics of the participants led to the results, not the program itself.","",""

Although the original evaluation of BOPD was a randomized controlled trial, this study focused on the outcomes of a nonrandom subset of BOPD participants who had completed a trial work period (TWP). Data sources included Wisconsin Unemployment Insurance administrative records and Social Security Administration (SSA) administrative data to evaluate study sample outcomes for 2009 and 2010.
The study found that treatment group members who completed a TWP were significantly more likely to be employed or earn at least three times more than the substantial gainful activity (SGA) amount than control group TWP completers over the eight quarters of follow-up. However, there were no significant impacts on earnings.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it is based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design. This means we have confidence that the effects estimated in this study are attributable at least in part to the BOPD. However, as with any nonexperimental analysis, other factors not accounted for in the study could also have contributed to the estimated effects.","","Administered by SSA, the BOPD was a pilot test of the later Benefit Offset National Demonstration. The primary intervention was a benefit offset that replaced the so-called cash cliff SSDI recipients who work eventually experience. The cash cliff refers to the fact that SSDI recipients who have completed a nine-month TWP followed by a three-month grace period have all their SSDI benefits suspended or terminated if they earn more than a threshold amount known as substantial gainful activity (SGA). The benefit offset replaces the complete loss of all benefits for working SSDI recipients, instead gradually withdrawing the SSDI benefit by $1 for every $2 earned above the SGA amount. SSA discontinued benefit offset eligibility for BOPD treatment subjects who had not completed a TWP by December 31, 2008, which was two years earlier than BOPD treatment subjects had initially been told their benefit offset eligibility would expire.
BOPD was implemented in four states: Connecticut, Utah, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Apart from recruiting SSDI recipients who received benefits solely based on their own earnings records, had completed a trial work period within the past 72 months, and were not concurrently receiving Supplemental Security Income benefits, the states were free to select their own program eligibility criteria. The Wisconsin BOPD went into effect in August 2005 and was a collaboration of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, the University of Wisconsin-Stout, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Referred to as the Pathways Project, all aspects of the intervention—from recruitment to service provision— were administered through 21 nonprofit provider agencies across the state. Program enrollment ended after October 2006.","This study examined employment and earnings impacts among 419 Wisconsin BOPD participants based on (1) whether the participants were assigned to the treatment or control group and (2) whether the participants completed a TWP by December 31, 2008—within three years of random assignment.
Although the BOPD was a randomized controlled trial, this study was not because it grouped subjects into treatment and comparison groups based in part on a post-random assignment characteristic—TWP completion before 2009. However, the authors demonstrated that there were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics between the treatment and comparison groups compared in the study.
The authors analyzed outcome data from Wisconsin Unemployment Insurance administrative records. In addition, they used SSA administrative records and BOPD data on participants’ characteristics and treatment group assignment.","Treatment group members who completed a TWP were 3 percentage points more likely to be employed relative to control group members who completed a TWP at the eighth quarter of follow-up. In addition, treatment group TWP completers were 5.6 percentage points more likely to earn at least three times the SGA amount than control group TWP completers. These differences were statistically significant.
Among TWP completers, there were no statistically significant impacts on earnings.","The volunteers who participated in the BOPD are not likely to be representative of the larger SSDI recipient population because they were typically recruited from organizations that helped clients obtain employment, and are therefore likely to be representative of the 20 percent of SSDI recipients who reported an expectation of returning to work. In addition, the decision by SSA to restrict eligibility to SSDI recipients who completed their TWP within the past 72 months disqualified potential participants with longer work histories; these people might have benefited the most from the program.","",""

BAM provided mentoring and socialization activities to enhance cognitive, decision-making, and social skills.
The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted in one high school on the south side of Chicago, Illinois, in 2012–2013. Eligible youth were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) a treatment group receiving BAM only, in which individuals could participate in the BAM program; (2) a treatment group receiving BAM plus tutoring, in which individuals could participate in the BAM program and received daily tutoring in math; or (3) the control group, which could not participate in BAM but could access existing services at their school. The authors estimated regressions to measure the impact of the BAM program on academic achievement using administrative data from Chicago Public Schools.
The study found that youth offered the opportunity to participate in BAM—either with or without supplemental tutoring—had significantly higher math achievement test scores than youth in the control group. In addition, youth in the BAM program group and the BAM plus tutoring program group had significantly higher math GPAs than members of the control group.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high for the GPA and course failures outcomes because it was based on a randomized controlled trial with low attrition. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to BAM and/or the tutoring sessions, and not to other factors. The quality of causal evidence is moderate for the math and reading achievement outcomes because these outcomes had high attrition but the authors included sufficient controls in their analysis. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to BAM and/or tutoring sessions, but other factors might also have contributed.","","The BAM program was aimed at youth at the highest risk of academic failure, based on a risk index factoring in number of course failures, unexcused absences, and age compared with classmates. The program consisted of up to 27 one-hour, weekly group mentoring sessions facilitated by Youth Guidance, a nonprofit organization in Chicago that developed and implemented the BAM program. Mentoring sessions were designed to help improve youths’ non-academic skills by promoting socialization and positive changes in behavior. Exercises included evaluating peers’ perspectives, foreseeing consequences, and interacting in groups.
For the BAM plus tutoring program, youth received the same weekly BAM mentoring sessions and daily one-hour math tutoring sessions during the school day. These sessions included two youth and one adult tutor.","Study participants were male youth in 9th or 10th grades attending a high school on the south side of Chicago in the 2012–2013 school year. Students missing more than 60 percent of class days or failing more than 75 percent of their classes were not eligible for the study. Youth in the study came from highly disadvantaged backgrounds, with 99 percent eligible for free or reduced-price lunch.
Eligible youth were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) a treatment group that could participate in BAM only; (2) a treatment group that could participate in BAM and received math tutoring; and (3) a control group that could not participate in the BAM program or tutoring, but could access existing services in the school or community.
The authors estimated the impact of the program by combining all students assigned to either treatment group and comparing them with the control group. The authors used administrative data from the Chicago Public Schools system to estimate regressions, controlling for demographic characteristics and pre-intervention academic achievement. The authors estimated the impact of the treatment groups on math and non-math GPAs, number of math and non-math course failures, and math and reading standardized test scores.","The study found that students offered the opportunity to participate in BAM, either with or without the math tutoring, had significantly fewer non-math course failures. Specifically, the treatment groups experienced, on average, 1.5 fewer non-math course failures relative to the control group.
Students in both treatment groups had math GPAs that were 0.43 points higher than the control group on a 1 to 4 scale. The study also found that the treatment groups’ national percentile rank in math achievement tests were on average 11.9 points higher than the control group. Both the math GPA and math achievement score findings were statistically significant.
The study found no significant differences between the treatment groups and the control group for math courses failed, reading achievement test scores, and non-math GPAs.","Although the study was a well-implemented randomized controlled trial, the math and reading achievement test score outcomes were missing for many students, which resulted in high attrition for those outcomes. Therefore, these outcomes cannot receive a high causal evidence rating. However, because the analysis of these results included sufficient controls for pre-program characteristics of the treatment and control groups, they receive a moderate causal evidence rating.
In addition, the authors combined the treatment group assigned to BAM and supplemental math tutoring sessions with the treatment group assigned only to BAM in their analysis. Although this did not affect the study’s causal evidence rating, it complicated interpretation of the results because it was not possible to disentangle the impacts of BAM itself and of the tutoring. It was possible that the math tutoring, and not BAM, was responsible for the observed effects, or vice versa.","",""

Year Up is an intensive, yearlong program that provides training and internships in financial operations and information technology for young adults from low-income urban communities.
About 200 students in three cities were randomly assigned to the treatment group, which was eligible to participate in Year Up beginning in September 2007, or the control group, which was not eligible to participate in Year Up in 2007. Members of the control group were eligible to reapply to the program after 10 months, and many did.

The quality of the causal evidence presented in this study is moderate because, although it was based on a randomized controlled trial with high attrition, the authors demonstrated that the treatment and control groups were similar before the intervention. This means we have confidence that the estimated effects are attributable at least in part to Year Up, although other factors could also have contributed.","","The Year Up program provides intense, focused training and a paid internship to prepare young adults for careers in information technology and financial operations. The program targets young adults ages 18 to 24 from low-income urban communities. Participants in the three programs examined in this study were primarily African American (54 percent) or Latino (34 percent), most lived with a parent or guardian (84 percent), and 17 percent lived in public housing. In addition, most participants had a high school diploma (89 percent) and had some previous experience working for pay (90 percent).
Through Year Up, youth received six months of intensive training followed by a six-month internship. The training included general skills training, such as the use of basic software and computer operating systems, and specific training in either the information technology or financial operations fields. Those in the information technology track learned about computer repair, installation, and networks; those in the financial operations track learned about financial portfolio management. Training also addressed business communications skills such as grammar, verbal communication, and writing and editing emails, and professional skills such as appropriate dress and body language, interacting with coworkers, and how to network.
Internships took place at major corporations in the area such as Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Chase, and CVS Caremark. Participants were offered support services, including access to social workers and a mentor outside of the program to provide professional guidance and development and to help with job searches or college applications when participants finished the program. Participants also received stipends for both the classroom training and internship, depending on their attendance and adherence to a performance contract.","Because more youth applied for the program than there were slots available, 195 participants in three sites were randomly assigned to the treatment (135 participants) or control group (60 participants) in September 2007. Those in the control group were placed on a waiting list and were allowed to reapply to the program in 10 months.
The authors compared the outcomes of the treatment and control groups using data collected through telephone interviews with participants in September 2011, four years after random assignment. Of the participants, 102 treatment group members and 41 control group members responded to the survey.","The authors reported a statistically significant impact of Year Up on earnings measured three years after random assignment ($19,955 versus $14,922), but this impact did not extend to the fourth year after random assignment. Cumulatively, treatment group members earned $13,645 more than the control group over years 2 through 4 after random assignment (and, hence, after participation in Year Up would have ended).
Treatment group members were more likely to have been employed in a field targeted by the program—financial operations or information technology—over the follow-up period than control group members (49 versus 17 percent).
Among those employed at the end of the follow-up period, treatment group members were significantly more likely to be employed as permanent rather than temporary staff (85 versus 70 percent) and have tuition assistance available through their employers (34 versus 17 percent) than control group members.
There were no statistically significant impacts on educational achievement.","Twenty-nine percent of control group members participated in Year Up in some capacity. This could dilute the estimates of program impacts because they received a similar set of services as treatment group members. In addition, the sample size is small, which means that only relatively large differences in outcomes between the treatment and control groups would be detectable.","Boston, Massachusetts

The VetStart program included 10 weeks of entrepreneurship courses followed by nine months of business mentorship and reimbursement of start-up business costs. Fourteen military veterans from a Midwestern community participated in the study over an 18-month period from spring 2012 to spring 2013.
The authors used participants’ survey responses before and after participation in the program to measure participants’ level of entrepreneurial passion and frequency of consultations with informal networks (which included family, friends, business associates, and other entrepreneurs) about their new business ideas. The authors defined entrepreneurial passion along three dimensions: founding passion (interest in creating a new organization as an entrepreneur), inventing passion (interest in developing new products or ideas as an entrepreneur), and developing passion (interest in expanding an existing entrepreneurial idea or organization).
The study found that the VetStart participants had higher levels of founding, inventing, and developing passion after the program than they did before it.
The study also found that the VetStart participants consulted their informal networks regarding their business ideas more after the program than before it.","","","","","","",""

The authors also investigated whether obtaining a post-secondary degree impacted similar outcomes, the profile of which can be found here.
The authors used a nonexperimental design (propensity score matching) to create a comparison group of former prisoners who were similar to the secondary degree program graduates but who did not complete a secondary degree while incarcerated. The authors estimated the program’s impact using data from the Minnesota Department of Employee and Economic Development, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, and the Correctional Operations Management System database maintained by MnDOC.
The authors found no relationship between completing a secondary degree and recidivism.
The quality of causal evidence on recidivism outcomes presented in this report is moderate because it is based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects would have been attributable to completing a secondary degree through MnDOC if the study had found statistically significant effects.","Absence of conflict of interest.","MnDOC offers educational programing at the secondary and post-secondary levels to inmates in all of the state’s correctional facilities. Educational programming is mandatory for all inmates who do not have at least a high school diploma or a GED. MnDOC verifies high school or GED completion and administers the Test of Adult Basic Education to all incoming inmates to determine whether inmates will be mandated to participate.","The authors used a statistical approach called propensity score matching to create a comparison group of former prisoners who were similar to the graduates of MnDOC’s secondary educational program (the treatment group). Participants and comparison group members were drawn from the 9,394 Minnesota inmates released from 2007 to 2008. Of these, 3,582 entered prison without a secondary degree, and 1,212 completed a degree in prison. Using propensity score matching, the authors compared inmates with no secondary degree with similar inmates who completed a secondary degree in prison. The authors used statistical models to compare outcomes of program graduates with those of the comparison group. Outcomes included employment and earnings outcomes based on data from the Minnesota Department of Employee and Economic Development, the risk of being reconvicted for a new crime based on Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension data, and the risk of being re-incarcerated for a new crime or having parole revoked for a technical violation based on data from MnDOC’s Correctional Operations Management System.","Employment
The authors found that inmates who completed a secondary degree in prison were more likely to be employed after release than those who entered and exited prison without completing a secondary degree.
Earnings
The authors found no statistically significant difference in terms of post-release earnings between those who completed a secondary degree in prison and those who entered and exited prison without completing a secondary degree.
Recidivism
The authors found no statistically significant differences in recidivism between those who completed a secondary degree in prison and those who entered and exited prison without completing a secondary degree. These results held across multiple measures of recidivism including time to reconviction, time to re-incarceration for a new sentence, and time to revocation for a technical violation.","Although the authors used a well-implemented nonexperimental design, they did not account for differences between groups’ employment and earnings histories before program participation. Preexisting differences between the groups—and not the program—could explain the observed differences in employment outcomes.","",""

Evidence from Burkina Faso’s Bright project","The study’s objective was to examine the impact of the BRIGHT project on school participation and child labor in Burkina Faso in West Africa.
The study used a regression discontinuity design. Villages were assigned to the treatment and comparison groups based on a numeric score (a constructed index score of how likely the program would benefit girls). Villages above the cut-off score received the program; villages below did not receive the program. Using survey data from schools and households, the authors analyzed the impact of the program on child labor, school enrollment, and school attendance for children aged 5-12.
The study found that participation in the BRIGHT project was significantly associated with an increase in the probability of children working in the family business or selling goods on the streets. However, program participation was also significantly related to an increase in school enrollment and attendance.
This study used a regression discontinuity design and therefore was reviewed using CLEAR’s descriptive study evidence review guidelines. As such, it does not receive a causal rating.","Absence of conflict of interest.","The BRIGHT project, in Burkina Faso, West Africa, was funded by the Millennium Challenge Corporation, and designed to increase school participation. In Burkina Faso, 37 percent of children aged 5-14 attended school and 38 percent of children aged 5-14 participated in an economic activity for an average of over 20 hours per week. Most the economic activity for children was unpaid work in agriculture (69%) and domestically in other households (22%). The BRIGHT project was a package of interventions with two primary components: (1) building schools in the villages and (2) providing incentives for school attendance including textbooks, school kits, and in-school meals. Girls with a monthly attendance rate of 90% also received take-home rations. The BRIGHT project started in 2005 and by 2007 most of the schools had been constructed.","The authors used a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to compare the outcomes in the treatment villages and the comparison villages. Ten rural provinces (Banwa, Gnagana, Komandjari, Namentenga, Oudalan, Sanmentenga, Seno, Soum, Tapoa, and Yagha) with the lowest levels of girls’ primary school completion were selected to participate. Forty-nine departments in the provinces nominated 293 villages to be part of the program. Representatives from nominated villages completed a 16-item weighted survey resulting in a numeric score. The survey included items on the number of girls in the village, school characteristics and plan to implement the program (heavily weighted on how likely the program was to help girls). Villages above the cut-off score received the program; villages below did not receive the program and served as the comparison group. Of these, 132 villages were selected to receive the program based on the cut-off score and the available funding. In each village, a census of households was conducted noting girls present and animals used for carrying heavy loads or heavy work such as donkeys (i.e., beasts of burden). To select the households that would complete the survey, the census was stratified into three groups: those that own a beast of burden, those that do not own an animal (such as a donkey or llama), but have access, and those that do not own or have access. Beast of burden served as a proxy for income level, with ownership indicating a higher income level for households. In each village, ten households from each strata (30 total) were randomly selected to be interviewed.
After the program ended in the spring of 2008, a household survey collected general characteristic data on the households such as race and ethnicity and information about the construction materials of the house as well as information about the children in the households aged 5-14 and their participation in work and school. Data about the schools, school personnel, and children’s school attendance were also collected through a school survey. Child labor outcomes included participation in five economic activities (work outside the household, work for pay outside the household, work in the family business or selling goods in the street, farming, and tending animals).","Employment/Child labor
The study found that participating in the BRIGHT project was significantly related to an increase in the probability of children working in the family business or selling goods on the streets. No other significant relationships were found for the other types of economic activity.
In a combined measure of “work,” including both economic activities inside and outside the home, the study found that participating in the BRIGHT project was significantly related to an increase in the probability of children working.
Education (School participation/enrollment)
The study found that participating in the BRIGHT project was significantly associated with an increase in school enrollment and school attendance (in school on last day and in school during roll call).","","",""

At some colleges, students assigned to the lowest level of developmental writing or math were required to complete an accelerated sequence of only one or two developmental courses before moving to college-level courses, compared with the longer sequence of two or three courses required at other colleges.
This nonexperimental study used regression analysis and propensity-score matching to estimate the impact of accelerated developmental writing and math sequences among students in need of developmental courses from 2001 to 2007. CUNY’s Office of Institutional Research provided students’ data. The study reported outcomes three years after students first enrolled in community college.
The study found that students in the shorter math and writing sequences were more likely to enroll in and pass college-level math and writing. Students in the shorter writing sequence earned more credits, on average, within three years and were more likely to earn an associate’s or bachelor’s degree within five years than those in the longer writing sequence. Among students who enrolled in college English, however, those who had taken the shorter English sequence were 2.5 percentage points less likely to pass college English.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it was based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the accelerated developmental education program, but other factors might also have contributed.","","The CUNY community colleges in this study varied in the number of courses required in their developmental writing and math sequences. Some colleges required only one writing course worth 6 or 7 credits. The study considered this an accelerated developmental writing sequence, compared with the longer sequence of two courses worth 8 to 12 credits implemented at some colleges. An accelerated developmental math sequence included two courses with 3 to 6 arithmetic credits and 4 to 6 algebra credits. The longer sequence comprised three courses worth 3 arithmetic credits and 8 algebra credits. The study focused on students who scored a 2, 3, or 4 on the American College Test essay exam or who scored 17 to 26 on the Computer Adaptive Placement Assessment and Support System pre-algebra and algebra placement exams, and who therefore placed into the lowest level of developmental writing or math.","The study used regression analysis and propensity-score matching to estimate the impact of accelerated developmental writing and math sequences on enrollment, persistence, and academic achievement among students in need of developmental courses who enrolled from 2001 to 2007. The study compared students assigned to accelerated sequences of developmental courses (the treatment group) with students assigned to longer developmental course sequences (the comparison group). Data were provided by CUNY’s Office of Institutional Research and included 10 years of student-unit record college applications, placement exams, course transcripts, and degree attainment. The college application data included demographic information, financial aid status, grades, and test scores. Outcomes were examined three years and five years after students first enrolled in community college.","Students in the shorter writing sequence were 9.7 percentage points more likely to enroll in and 6.1 percentage points more likely to complete college English courses than students in the longer writing sequence, significant at the 1 percent level.
Similarly, students in the shorter math course were 3.5 percentage points more likely to enroll in college math and 3.0 percentage points more likely to complete it, significant at the 1 percent level.
Students in the shorter writing sequence completed, on average, 2.1 more credits within three years than those in the longer sequence. They also were 2.2 percentage points more likely to earn an associate’s and/or bachelor’s degree within five years. Both of these results were significant at the 1 percent level.
Among students who enrolled in college English, students who had taken the shorter English sequence were 2.5 percentage points less likely to pass college English, compared with the matched sample of those who were in the longer sequence. This difference was significant at the 5 percent level.","There were some differences in the curriculum of the longer and shorter sequences. Thus, the study measured the impact not just of longer or shorter sequences, but also of these curriculum differences.
In addition, the study authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to progress toward degree completion. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","",""

The study found that, compared with those who registered for services at the Labor Exchange, participants in the WIA Adult Program had higher employment rates and average quarterly earnings and lower receipt of unemployment insurance benefits.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not ensure that the groups being compared were similar before program participation. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the WIA Adult Program; other factors are likely to have contributed.

Please click here to find CLEAR profiles of those studies.","","The WIA Adult Program was authorized by Title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 and was superseded by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), effective in July 2015. The Adult Program services, which remained essentially the same under WIOA, were designed to provide quality employment and training services to eligible workers. Administered through local workforce investment areas, the Adult Program served all people ages 18 and older through a set of core services; these include job placement assistance, skills assessments, and provision of information on the labor market, among other services. In addition, those unable to obtain a job through core services alone could receive intensive services—including counseling and specialized assessments—and vouchers for training attendance. Recipients of public assistance and other low-income people received priority for intensive and training services in local workforce investment areas in which program funds were limited. In addition, some local areas provided supportive services such as child care, transportation, and work-related financial assistance to those who qualified.","The authors collected Unemployment Insurance records for those who had exited the WIA Adult Program from July 2005 to June 2006 to estimate the long-term impacts of the program in quarters 9 to 12 after program exit. They also collected Unemployment Insurance records for those who exited from July 2007 to June 2008 to estimate the short-term impacts in the third quarter after program exit. In Washington State, there were 3,874 adults who exited the WIA program in 2005–2006 and 2,864 who exited in 2007–2008. The comparison group was composed of people ages 22 to 60 at the time of exiting the Labor Exchange program who registered at the Labor Exchange. The authors used a nonexperimental statistical approach called propensity-score matching to create a comparison group that was similar to the WIA Adult Program group in terms of demographic characteristics, including gender, age, educational attainment, race, employment, and program participation history. The authors used a difference-in-differences model to compare the two groups on employment, hourly wages, hours worked per quarter, quarterly earnings, and receipt of benefits before and after participation.","Employment. The authors reported that the percentage of quarters employed increased significantly by 12.8 percentage points more in the third quarter after exit and 10.8 percentage points more in quarters 9 to 12 after exit for those who took part in the WIA Adult Program compared with those who registered at the Labor Exchange. The treatment group also worked significantly more hours than the comparison group, with an average increase of 41.1 hours worked in the third quarter after exit and 66.4 hours worked in quarters 9 to 12 after program exit.
Earnings. The authors reported that average quarterly earnings increased significantly for those who took part in the WIA Adult Program compared with those who registered at the Labor Exchange, with an average increase of $1,189 more in the third quarter after exit and $766 more in quarters 9 to 12 after exit. The hourly wage also increased significantly for the treatment group, with an average increase of $1.99 more per hour in the third quarter and $1.44 more per hour 9 to 12 quarters after exit.
Public benefit receipt: The authors reported that, compared with those who registered with the Labor Exchange, the rate of benefit use among WIA program participants significantly decreased by 1.7 percentage points in the third quarter after program exit and 1.9 percentage points in quarters 9 to 12 after program exit. The amount of benefits received was also significantly reduced by $59 in the third quarter after exit for the WIA group compared with the Labor Exchange group.","Although the authors accounted for many underlying characteristics of the groups being compared, which could also influence their outcomes, the authors’ decision to define the groups based on their date of program exit rather than program entry is problematic. For example, suppose that the WIA Adult and Labor Exchange participants were on identical wage trajectories before receiving services from their respective programs, and that the average length of participation in WIA services was six months, whereas that for Labor Exchange was one month. At the conclusion of participation, they exited the program.
If we compared the groups’ earnings 6 months after their recorded exit dates, we would observe WIA participants’ earnings about 12 months after they started receiving services and Labor Exchange participants’ earnings about 7 months after they started receiving services. If both programs were completely ineffective and everyone stayed on their original upward-sloping wage trajectory, it would appear as though the WIA participants earned more 6 months after their exit dates. However, this would not be attributable to receiving WIA services; it would be caused by the different elapsed time across the groups (12 months for WIA participants versus 7 months for Labor Exchange participants). Therefore, studies defining the groups based on exit date, rather than entry date, cannot receive a moderate causal evidence rating.","",""

If we compared the groups’ earnings 6 months after their recorded exit dates, we would be looking at WIA participants’ earnings about 12 months after they started receiving services and Labor Exchange participants’ earnings about 7 months after they started receiving services. If both programs were completely ineffective and everyone stayed on their original upward-sloping wage trajectory, it would appear as though the WIA participants earned more 6 months after their exit dates. However, this would not be attributable to receiving WIA training; it would be caused by the difference in elapsed time (12 months for WIA participants versus 7 months for Labor Exchange participants). Therefore, studies defining the groups based on exit date, rather than entry date, cannot receive a moderate causal evidence rating.","",""

The California STRIVE program examined in this study consisted of job readiness classes for 40 hours a week for three to four weeks, employment placement assistance, and access to a computer lab for resume writing and job search activities. In addition, housing was available to those released within the last 24 hours. Forty-seven percent of those assigned to the treatment group graduated from the STRIVE program.","The study site was a single community-based organization providing reentry services in an unnamed community in Southern California.

The authors noted two considerations for interpreting the findings. First, the study recruited only about 60 percent of the sample they originally intended to randomly assign. Smaller than expected sample sizes might limit the study’s ability to detect differences in the outcomes between the treatment and control groups. Second, almost three-quarters of the control group received alternate services in the community, which might have included employment services. If control group members received services similar to the treatment group, this might have made it more difficult to detect the impact of the STRIVE program.","",""

The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because it was based on a randomized controlled trial with high attrition and the authors did not demonstrate that groups were similar at baseline. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Kenya Cash Transfer Programme for Orphans and Vulnerable Children; other factors are likely to have contributed.","Absence of conflict of interest.","The Kenya Cash Transfer Programme for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (CT-OVC) is the government’s primary poverty reduction program. It focuses on the poorest households with at least one vulnerable child defined as an orphan or child with a chronically ill parent or caregiver aged 17 or younger. The program aims to improve household economic outcomes and to improve the care of OVC through a monthly cash transfer (equivalent to $21 USD in 2007).
From 2007-2011, UNICEF contracted a randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of the CT-OVC program on household welfare indicators, including child labor. Seven Kenyan districts with high rates of poverty and HIV/AIDS were selected to implement the program. Since the program could not be implemented across all locations in the districts at the same time, four locations were selected within each district and were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group. In the treatment locations, a committee of local citizens identified households to receive the monthly cash stipend based on poverty and the vulnerable child criteria described above, while households in the control group did not receive the stipend. Eligible households completed a socioeconomic questionnaire to confirm eligibility. The sample was narrowed through eligibility verification and availability of program funding per district, with preference first given to households that were child-led, and then to adult-led households, beginning with the oldest heads of household. In the control locations, the households identified by the local committee based on poverty and the vulnerable child criteria were included in the control group. The baseline sample included 2,294 households (1,542 treatment and 755 control). Treatment households received monthly cash transfers.","This study used survey data from the clustered randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of the CT-OVC program on child labor. Survey responses were examined at baseline and four years after the start of the program. The 2011 sample included 1,811 households (1,280 and 531 control).

The study found a statistically significant relationship between the CT-OVC program and an increase in school enrollment for children ages 12-18. However, the authors did not provide the data associated with this finding.","The original study was a randomized controlled trial with high attrition from the sample. Because attrition affected the treatment and control groups’ comparability on background characteristics that could have affected the outcomes of interest, CLEAR reviews the study as a quasi-experimental design. While the study accounted for demographic differences between the treatment and control groups, the authors did not account for the child outcomes at baseline. As a result, preexisting differences between the groups—and not the program/intervention—could explain the observed differences in outcomes. In particular, there may have already been a lower rate of child labor in the treatment group prior to the study which could account for the significantly lower rate of child labor in the treatment group four years after the start of the program. Also, one of the Kenyan districts was not included in the assessment of the child labor outcomes and this may have created additional pre-existing differences between the two groups.","",""

Using survey data from a randomized controlled trial, the authors analyzed the average program impact of the Oportunidades program on schooling and work for boys and girls using a statistical model.
The study found that Oportunidades significantly increased school participation for boys and girls and significantly decreased participation in work for boys only.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this study is moderate because, although it was based on a randomized controlled trial with high attrition, the authors demonstrated that the treatment and control groups were similar before the intervention. This means we have confidence that the estimated effects are attributable at least in part to Oportunidades, although other factors could also have contributed.","Absence of Conflict of Interest.","From 1997 to 2012, the Oportunidades program provided monthly conditional cash transfers to 5.8 million households, which is around 20 percent of the average total household income. The cash transfer is conditional upon child school attendance (85% of days) for children under 18 and health clinic visits for household members, as well as the requirement for pregnant women and lactating women to take nutritional supplements and go to five pre-natal visits. The amount of the cash transfer varies by gender and increases with the grade of the child. However, if a child repeats a grade twice, he or she will permanently lose the cash transfer.","The study used survey data from a randomized controlled trial. The original study was conducted across 506 rural communities in 7 states in Mexico. The communities were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups (320 communities in the treatment group and 186 in the control group). Poor households, based on a marginality index, were selected to participate in the program.
In this study, the authors used the 1997 baseline Survey of Household Socio-Economic Characteristics (ENCASEH) as well as information from follow-up surveys completed in October 1998, March 1999, and November 1999. The authors restricted the sample to children 8 to 14 years old at the time of the baseline survey and to those having complete information across the baseline and follow-up surveys.

Using administrative data from the Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS), the National Student Clearinghouse, and Kentucky’s unemployment insurance program, the authors compared the outcomes of students who completed college degrees, diplomas, and certificates with those of students who did not.
The study found that community college degrees, diplomas, and certificates improved earnings for those who received them, compared with those who did not receive them but were otherwise similar.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it was based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design; this is the highest causal evidence rating possible for a nonexperimental design. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to earning community college degrees, diplomas, and certificates, but other factors might also have contributed.","","The program under study was typical community college enrollment and participation at KCTCS, with no additional services or enhancements.","The study used administrative data from the KCTCS, the National Student Clearinghouse, and the state’s unemployment insurance program. The study sample included 25,453 students who entered KCTCS during the 2003–2004 or 2004–2005 school years with the intent of receiving an associate’s degree, diploma, or certificate. The sample was 65 percent female, 77 percent white, and 23 percent nonwhite. Average age at entry was 31 years. The authors noted that the sample was younger and had lower income than the state average, which is consistent with the fact that students tend to be younger than the general population and earnings among the young are below the general population average.
The authors used a difference-in-differences model to examine the effect of receiving a degree, diploma, or certificate (award). Essentially, the model compared the earnings trajectories of the same people before and after receiving an award with the earnings trajectories of similar people who did not receive an award. The model included controls for students’ demographic characteristics that change over time, the county unemployment rate, and a set of variables measuring students’ self-reported educational intentions.","Women and men who received associate’s degrees earned an average of $2,363 and $1,484, respectively, more in quarterly earnings than similar women and men who did not receive an associate’s degree. These differences were statistically significant.
Women and men who received diplomas earned an average of $1,914 and $1,265, respectively, more in quarterly earnings than similar women and men who did not receive a diploma. These differences were statistically significant.
Women who received certificates earned an average of $299 more quarterly than similar women who did not receive a certificate. This difference was statistically significant. There was no statistically significant impact of receiving a certificate on the earnings of men in the sample.","The authors noted that their study relied on a fundamental assumption, common to any difference-in-differences model, that the pre- and post-KCTCS earnings patterns were similar between students who received an award and students who did not.

Students from 13 high schools were recruited to the program and randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups or a control group. Students in the jobs-only treatment group were offered 25 hours per week of paid employment; students in the jobs + SEL treatment group were offered 15 hours of paid employment and 10 hours of social-emotional learning (SEL) weekly. Students in the control group were excluded from the program but free to pursue other opportunities.
The study found that students in the One Summer Plus program had significantly fewer arrests for violent crimes in the 16 months following random assignment, compared with students in the control group (5 arrests per 100 youth compared with 9 arrests per 100 youth, equivalent to a 43 percent reduction). There were no statistically significant impacts of the program on the other criminal justice or educational outcomes examined.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-conducted randomized controlled trial.","","One Summer Plus provided eight weeks of summer employment to students in Chicago. Chapin Hall, a research center at the University of Chicago, used administrative data to identify the 5,000 youth in Chicago with the highest risk of violence. The city of Chicago identified 13 high schools in which many of these youth were enrolled. To be eligible for the One Summer Plus program, youth at these 13 schools (or those planning to enroll in 9th grade at the schools the following fall) had to be 14 to 21 years old.
Youth in One Summer Plus were placed in jobs earning the minimum wage ($8.25 per hour) at nonprofit organizations and government agencies, including summer camps, community gardens, YMCAs, aldermen’s offices, and so on. For the jobs-only group, the jobs were 5 hours a day for five days a week (a total of 25 hours of work per week). Members of the jobs + SEL group were paid for attending 2 hours of SEL services and working 3 hours each day (also a total of 25 hours of programming per week). SEL services, based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles, focused on behavior, emotional health, managing conflict in the workplace, and setting goals. In addition, the program assigned youth job mentors to teach them how to be successful employees and how to overcome potential barriers to employment. One Summer Plus youth received one meal a day and a bus reimbursement, if necessary.","The author recruited youth in the targeted high schools for the study and randomly assigned 1,634 students to one of three conditions: the jobs-only treatment group (350 students), the jobs + SEL treatment group (350 students), or the control group (934 students), blocking for gender and school. The author randomly ordered students in the control group to form a waiting list for services. When 30 students in the treatment groups indicated they would not participate in the program, 30 students on the waiting list were offered admission to the program. The author analyzed the 30 students who left and the 30 new students as part of the treatment group.
On average, the students participating in the study were 16.8 years old, predominantly African American, and 92 percent were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. Before the program, 19 percent of the control and 22 percent of the treatment groups had been arrested.
The author analyzed impacts during and after the program on academic outcomes from Chicago Public Schools administrative data and on criminal justice outcomes from the Chicago Police Department’s arrest records. The primary outcomes of interest were four arrest-related outcomes (violent crime, property crime, drug crime, and other crime arrests); number of violent victimizations; and schooling outcomes (any attendance, number of days present, and grade point average in the following school year).","The study presented findings based on a comparison of the combined treatment groups with the control group:
The combined treatment groups had significantly fewer violent crime arrests in the 16 months following random assignment, compared with students in the control group: 5 arrests per 100 youth compared with 9 arrests per 100 youth, a 43 percent reduction.
There were no statistically significant differences between the combined treatment groups and the control group in arrests for property, drug, or other crimes in the 16 months following random assignment.
There were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups and the control group on the number of days present and grade point average in the 2012–2013 school year (the school year following program intervention in summer 2012).
When looking at each treatment group separately compared with the control group, the study found the groups were equally effective at reducing violent crime arrests.","Because the random assignment design included the random ordering of control group members on a waiting list as a feature of the randomization, moving the 30 students from the waiting list to the treatment group did not compromise the random assignment design. Therefore, the study receives a high causal evidence rating. The author reported that program participation was high, with about three-quarters of those offered the opportunity to participate in One Summer Plus actually participating. Of those who started, almost all were assigned a job placement, and some 90 percent completed seven weeks of programming.","",""

Receipt of the scholarship is not conditional on any factors, which distinguishes the program from a conditional cash transfer program.

It measured impacts seven years after random assignment. Students in the Opening Doors learning communities took three linked courses during one semester and received tutoring and case management services.
The study was a randomized controlled trial. Eligible students were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which was offered the opportunity to participate in one of the learning communities, or the control group, which was not allowed to enroll in a learning community. The primary data sources were a baseline survey on the background characteristics of students, student transcripts, degree attainment information from the National Student Clearinghouse, and employment and earnings information from Unemployment Insurance (UI) wage records in New York.
The study found no significant impacts on the number of credits earned or attempted, completion of any college degree, or employment or earnings in the seventh year after random assignment.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects would be attributable to the learning communities, and not to other factors.","","At Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn, New York, the Opening Doors learning communities program involved enrolling small cohorts of students in three linked courses during one semester. These learning communities involved an English course, a college-level course required for a specific major, and a one-credit freshman orientation class. The freshman orientation class was a seminar designed to reinforce the learning objectives of the other two courses. Each learning community also had a case manager who offered academic guidance to students and a tutor who provided students with one-on-one tutoring. Learning community students were also provided with $150 textbook vouchers. This study focused on four cohorts of students who participated in learning communities from 2003 to 2005 and examined their educational, employment, and earnings outcomes seven years later.
To be eligible to participate in the Opening Doors learning communities, students had to be first-time incoming freshman ages 17 to 34 planning to attend college full-time during the day, and be enrolled in either a developmental or college-level English course. Although not a specific requirement for eligibility throughout program implementation, the program targeted low- and moderate-income students.","This study was a randomized controlled trial. Randomization occurred at the student level, separately for each cohort (fall 2003, spring 2004, fall 2004, and spring 2005). Eligible students who consented to participate in the study filled out a baseline data form. Then, the students were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which was offered the opportunity to enroll in a learning community, or the control group, which could not enroll in a learning community, but could access existing college services. There were 1,534 students in the study with 769 in the treatment group and 765 in the control group.
The authors used data from the baseline data form, student transcripts, and the National Student Clearinghouse for outcomes related to progress toward degree completion. The authors used data from UI wage records from the New York State Department of Labor to report outcomes on the earnings and employment of participants. The authors estimated program impacts for the pooled sample using a linear regression model that included students’ baseline characteristics and fixed effects for student cohorts. The main focus of this study was on students’ outcomes seven years after random assignment.","The study found no significant impacts on the number of credits earned or attempted, or completion of any college degree in the seventh year after random assignment for all cohorts.
The study found no significant impacts on employment or earnings in the seventh year after random assignment for all cohorts.","Although all the basic features of the Opening Doors learning community were implemented at Kingsborough Community College, the authors noted a few concerns with fidelity to the program model. First, although the program planned for classes to have about 25 students, the learning community courses were often underenrolled, with class sizes varying from 6 to 25 students and averaging 17 students. Second, the level of integration between courses and collaboration among faculty teaching the linked courses varied by learning community, which might have dampened the overall impact of the integrative component of the Opening Doors learning community model at Kingsborough.
The authors noted that the analysis of earnings might be underpowered due to relatively small sample sizes, which means that the study would detect only very large earnings differences between the program and control groups.
This study examined the impact of a one-semester program seven years after random assignment. Over the course of the long follow-up period, it is possible the program impacts had faded.","",""

The study used a randomized controlled trial to assess the intervention. Child outcomes were compared between the treatment and control group households, using data from follow-up surveys administered two years after the start of the intervention.
The study found that there were no significant relationships between participation in the program and school attendance or child labor.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because randomization was compromised and the authors did not ensure that the groups being compared were similar before the intervention. This means that if there were significant effects, we would not be confident that they were attributable to Kenya CT-OVC; other factors are likely to have contributed.","Absence of conflict of interest.","The Kenya Cash Transfer for Orphans and Vulnerable Children Program (Kenya CT-OVC) provided cash transfers to households with vulnerable children, many who had at least one deceased parent. Households participating in the program received a monthly cash transfer valued at $24 USD. Initially, the plan was that some households would participate in a Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) version of the program, where certain requirements needed to be met to receive the transfers, or would participate in an Unconditional Cash Transfer (UCT) version of the program, where those requirements did not need to be met. In the CCT version, the requirements would include regular school attendance, visits to health clinics, and adult educational sessions. However, across communities, there were varying levels of restriction on whether households needed to meet certain conditions; these variations were not measured. As a result, the authors combined the CCT and UCT households into one treatment group. Eligible households met the following criteria: were poor, were not participants in another cash transfer program, and had one or more OVC. An OVC was a child younger than 18, who fit into at least one of the following categories: had a deceased parent, had a chronic illness, lived in a household headed by a child, or had a caregiver with a chronic illness.","The study used a randomized controlled trial and took place in 7 districts in Kenya: Nairobi, Kwale, Garissa, Homa Baye, Migori, Kisumu, and Suba. Within each of the seven districts, four localities were selected. Two of these localities were randomly assigned to the treatment group and two were randomly assigned to the control group. Within the treatment communities, eligible households were selected into the study through a multi-step process: first, a committee administered a survey at households to assess whether they were eligible. Then, households that appeared to be eligible were asked to complete a longer survey to affirm that they were, in fact, eligible. While eligible households were asked to attend an event to enroll, the authors noted that in some communities there were more eligible household than there were program resources; in those cases, they prioritized households with the youngest and oldest caregivers. Households enrolled in the treatment group received the monthly cash transfer, and those in the control group did not. This paper focused on 4,843 children ages 4-15 at the start of the study (2,068 households), whose household had a survey at both baseline and follow-up. The authors compared outcomes of whether children participated in paid work and whether they attended school between the treatment and control groups and controlled for baseline group differences such as age, highest level of education among household adults, and ownership of land and livestock. The participation in paid work and school attendance outcomes were measured using data from a two-year follow-up survey,","Employment/Child labor
There was no statistically significant relationship between participation in the Kenya CT-OVC and the proportion of children who participated in paid work, as measured using data from the two-year follow-up survey.
Education (School participation/enrollment)
There was not a statistically significant relationship between participation in the Kenya CT-OVC and the proportion of children who attended school, as measured using data from the two-year follow-up survey.","Random assignment was compromised for this study because, after randomly assigning the localities to the treatment or control group, the authors used different procedures in each study group to identify households to participate in the study. In treatment localities, two rounds of screening questionnaires were used to confirm eligibility, and then households were prioritized giving favor to those with the youngest and oldest caregivers. Families then had to decide to attend an enrollment event. Control households were selected based on their baseline characteristics, but not using the same procedure as the treatment households. This implies that the households in the control group likely differed from those in the treatment group, defeating the intent of random assignment. In addition, the authors did not account for preexisting differences between the groups before program participation, such as child labor and child gender. These preexisting differences between the groups—and not the Kenya CT-OVC — could explain the observed differences in outcomes.","",""

The study used a post-test only design to assess differences in school enrollment and work participation between 5-17 year-old children in the CT-OVC program and those who were not in the program.
The study found that receipt of the cash transfer was significantly related to lower rates of child labor and higher rates of school enrollment.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not ensure that the groups being compared were similar before the intervention. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to CT-OVC; other factors are likely to have contributed.","Absence of Conflict of Interest.","The Kenya’s Cash Transfer to the Orphaned and Vulnerable Children CT-OVC program was operated by the local government with assistance from the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). The program aimed to support the welfare of children considered orphaned or vulnerable; this included children who had one or more parent who died, or who had a parent with a chronic health condition. These children had become more common due to the HIV/AIDs epidemic, which led to the development of the program. The selection process for the CT-OVC program was designed to target households with an OVC, and was conducted with input from the local communities, government, and donors. Households participating in the program received a cash transfer. Per the authors, there were no conditions for receiving the cash transfer but those receiving the payment were told of their responsibilities to care of the OVC who lived in their household. The program was implemented in multiple regions of Kenya, but the study was limited to the Kwale District.","The study had a post-test only design that compared child labor and school participation outcomes between children in households who participated in the CT-OVC program and those in households that did not. The researchers divided the potential sample into groups based on the type of OVC: two parents decreased, one parent decreased, or having both parents alive, but with at least one who was chronically ill. The researchers randomly selected a sample for the treatment and comparison groups within those categories. For each of the CT-OVC and the comparison groups, 100 households were sent the survey (200 households total). The researchers conducted analyses with completed surveys received from 86 of households in the CT-OVC group, and 86 in the comparison group (172 total), after removing three CT-OVC surveys that were physically damaged and could not be used. The researchers used regression analyses to compare the percent of children ages 5-17 in each group who participated in child labor and school, controlling for differences in a number of characteristics such as: child gender and age, household head education level and occupation, household size, and the type of OVC (one or no parents, or parent with a chronic illness).","Employment/Child labor 
The study found that the cash transfers were significantly associated with lower rates of child labor (84% of children in the treatment group worked compared to 93% of children in the comparison group).

The authors used a nonexperimental method to compare short-term (3 quarters after program exit) and long-term (9 to 12 quarters after program exit) employment, earnings, and Unemployment Insurance benefits between those who took part in private career school programs with those who registered for services at the Labor Exchange Employment Services.
The study found that, compared with those who registered for services at the Labor Exchange, participants in private career school programs had lower initial employment but higher long-term employment and earnings.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not ensure that the groups being compared were similar before program participation. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to private career school programs; other factors are likely to have contributed.
This study also examined the effectiveness of other workforce development programs.

Institutions that operate this program are privately operated and monitored by the Washington State Workforce Training and Education Coordinating Board.","The authors collected Unemployment Insurance records for those who had exited private career school programs from July 2005 to June 2006 to estimate the long-term impacts of the program in quarters 9 to 12 after program exit. They also collected Unemployment Insurance records for those who exited from July 2007 to June 2008 to estimate the short-term impacts in the third quarter after program exit. In Washington State, there were 12,691 people who exited private career school programs in 2005–2006 and 11,269 who exited in 2007–2008. The authors used a nonexperimental statistical approach called propensity-score matching to create a comparison group of people who registered for services at the Labor Exchange and were similar to the private career school programs group in terms of demographic characteristics, including gender, age, educational attainment, race, employment, and program participation history. The authors used a difference-in-differences model to compare the two groups on employment, hourly wages, hours worked per quarter, quarterly earnings, and receipt of benefits before and after participation.","Employment. The authors reported that the percentage of quarters employed decreased significantly by 2.7 percentage points in the third quarter after program exit but increased 3.4 percentage points in quarters 9 to 12 after exit for those who took part in the private career school programs compared with those who registered at the Labor Exchange. The treatment group significantly increased the number of hours worked by an average of 20 hours per quarter in the third quarter after exit and 25.5 hours in quarters 9 to 12 after exit relative to the comparison group.
Earnings. The authors reported that average quarterly earnings significantly increased for those who took part in private career school programs compared with those who registered at the Labor Exchange, with an average increase of $416 in the third quarter after exit and $394 9 to 12 quarters after program exit. The average hourly wage of the treatment group also significantly increased by an average of $0.91 in the third quarter after exit and $0.80 in quarters 9 to 12 after exit.
Public benefit receipt: The authors reported that, compared with those who registered with the Labor Exchange, the receipt of benefits among private career school program participants significantly decreased by 3.2 percentage points in the third quarter and 4.4 percentage points in quarters 9 to 12 after program exit. The amount of benefits received was also significantly reduced by $85 in the third quarter and $49 in quarters 9 to 12 after exit for the private career school programs group compared to the Labor Exchange group.","Although the authors accounted for many underlying characteristics of the groups being compared, which could also influence their outcomes, the authors’ decision to define the groups based on their date of program exit rather than program entry is problematic. For example, suppose that the private career school program and Labor Exchange participants were on identical wage trajectories before receiving services from their respective programs, and that the average length of participation in the private career school program was six months, whereas that for Labor Exchange was one month. At the conclusion of participation, they exited the program.
If we compared the groups’ earnings 6 months after their recorded exit dates, we would observe private career school participants’ earnings about 12 months after they started receiving services and Labor Exchange participants’ earnings about 7 months after they started receiving services. If both programs were completely ineffective and everyone stayed on their original upward-sloping wage trajectory, it would appear as though the private career school participants earned more 6 months after their exit dates. However, this would not be attributable to receiving private career school classes; it would be caused by the different elapsed time across the groups (12 months for private career school participants versus 7 months for Labor Exchange participants). Therefore, studies defining the groups based on exit date, rather than entry date, cannot receive a moderate causal evidence rating.","",""

The study used a difference-in-differences approach to compare the outcomes of women before and after changes in the disregard rate within their state relative to women in other states over the same time period.
The study did not find any statistically significant effects of earnings disregards on the outcomes of interest.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it was based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design; this is the highest causal evidence rating possible for a nonexperimental design. This means we would be somewhat confident that any estimated effects would be attributable to earnings disregards, but other factors might also have contributed. However, the study did not find statistically significant effects.","","Following welfare reform in 1996, many states opted through their Temporary Assistance for Needy Families programs to disregard a higher share of the earnings of working women used to calculate their welfare benefits. The increase in earnings disregards effectively reduces the implicit tax rate imposed on earnings, which according to economic theory should induce greater labor supply among low-wage workers. Holding earnings constant, higher earnings disregards should also increase income among welfare recipients by allowing them to retain a larger share of their total earnings.","The study used information on mothers’ income sources in the past year from the Current Population Survey and the Survey of Income and Program Participation from 1985 to 2004. The sample consisted of single mothers between the ages of 18 and 54 who had less than a high school education and were living with children age 18 or younger. The sample was on average 32 years old, 30 percent black, 32 percent Hispanic, and had two children living with them.
The authors conducted a difference-in-difference analysis to compare the employment, earnings, and public assistance receipt of women before and after changes in the disregard rate within their state relative to women in other states over the same time period. This model assumes that parallel trends in outcomes would exist across states absent any changes in earnings disregards. The authors showed the trends in women’s employment and earnings and concluded that the trends were fairly similar across states before welfare reform in 1996. In addition, the model took into account several individual-level and state-level time-varying characteristics and state-specific time trends.","The study did not find any statistically significant effects of earnings disregards on low-skilled single mothers’ employment, earnings, or public assistance receipt.","The authors suggested one reason for the lack of statistically significant findings could be that few employed women took advantage of the higher earnings disregards.","",""

Veterans were referred to the program and completed a series of baseline neurocognitive and neuropsychological assessments to determine eligibility. Eligible veterans were randomly assigned to either the CogSMART treatment group, which received supported employment, enhanced by CogSMART sessions, or to a control group that did not participate in CogSMART sessions.
The study found that veterans in the CogSMART group demonstrated statistically significant reductions in postconcussive symptoms and improvements in prospective memory functioning. Although a higher proportion of the treatment group entered competitive employment within 14 weeks of starting the program—50 percent compared to 26 percent in the control group—the difference was not statistically significant.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is low because it is a randomized controlled trial with high or unknown attrition and no control variables included in the analysis. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to CogSMART. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","CogSMART was developed from a review of prior cognitive training studies and used targeted rehabilitative techniques with demonstrated efficacy in populations with severe TBI, psychiatric disorders, and memory deficits related to neurologic pathology. This study focused on veterans with mild to moderate TBI to explore whether such techniques could have similar positive impacts in this population, leading to improved employability and mental health. CogSMART sessions included psychoeducation and cognitive training. Psychoeducation focused on postconcussive symptoms and management techniques such as stress reduction, sleep hygiene, and other lifestyle management strategies. Cognitive training included multi-modal compensatory interventions such as habit learning, acronym use, list making, conversational skills, alarms, calendars, problem-solving systems, and smartphone use to improve prospective memory, attention, learning, and executive functioning.
The treatment consisted of one year of standard supported employment programming, with one added treatment visit per week (lasting one hour) to receive the manualized CogSMART treatment during the first 12 weeks of the supported employment program. The supported employment program was a one-hour session each week emphasizing assisted rapid job searching for community-based employment opportunities that aligned with veterans’ interests and preferences. Both supported employment services and CogSMART were delivered by the same employment specialist.","The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial. Veterans were referred to the supported employment program by the Veterans Administration (VA) San Diego Healthcare System Wellness, Vocational Enrichment Clinic, Polytrauma Clinic, and Neuropsychological Assessment Unit. To be eligible for the study, veterans had to (1) be Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom veterans, (2) have a history of mild to moderate TBI (with added amnesia and loss-of-consciousness criteria), (3) have a documented impairment at least 1 standard deviation below the mean in at least one neuropsychological area, and (4) be unemployed but seeking to return to work. Veterans qualifying for other special substance abuse–related programs or who were participating in other studies were not accepted for the study. Eligible veterans completed a series of baseline neurocognitive and neuropsychological assessments and provided additional demographic and medical history data during the intake period.
Fifty veterans met the inclusion criteria for the study and were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which received supported employment plus CogSMART for one year, or the control group. Members of the control group received one year of supported employment services plus one added session per week of “enhanced supported employment” to ensure comparable amounts of time and contact with the employment specialists as those in the CogSMART group. Activities completed as part of the enhanced supported employment session were not described in the report.
Study data included neuropsychological measures collected at baseline and three-month follow up; these were administered by a research assistant, blinded to treatment assignment, using standardized procedures. Employment-related data were collected weekly from study participants. The authors estimated impacts by comparing the differences of treatment and control group members on outcomes of interest.","Statistically significant improvements were noted in postconcussive symptoms and prospective memory performance after three months, when participants had concluded the 12-week treatment period of the one-year supported employment program.
Although a higher proportion of the treatment group entered competitive employment within 14 weeks of starting the program—50 percent compared with 26 percent in the control group—this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.15).","Of the 50 veterans randomly assigned to treatment and control groups, outcomes were reported for only 16 in the treatment group and 18 in the control group. The authors did not state how many veterans had initially been assigned to each of the groups. If the groups were initially the same size, that implies that the study has high attrition according to CLEAR guidelines, which means the study cannot receive a high causal evidence rating. Random assignment studies with high attrition can receive a moderate causal evidence rating if they include statistical controls specified for each topic area. However, this study did not include any statistical controls, which means it cannot receive a moderate causal evidence rating.
In addition, the study did not report what records were used to assess competitive employment after 14 weeks and did not describe whether this employment was full-time, part-time, or in the preferred job arenas of the veterans in treatment.","",""

The focus of this profile is Florida’s Back to Work program, which placed participants in partially subsidized jobs in which employers were expected to cover 5 to 20 percent of the employee’s wages for up to one year.
For the evaluation of the Florida Back to Work program, the authors used administrative wage data to compare the employment and earnings outcomes of program participants with the employment and earnings outcomes of a similar group of people who were not placed in subsidized employment.
The study found that participants in Florida Back to Work were more likely to be employed and earned $1,921 more in the year following the program than those in the comparison group.

This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the subsidized employment program. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The Temporary Assistance to Needy Families Emergency Fund (EF) was created in 2009 through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The EF was intended to help states create or expand subsidized employment programs that created jobs for unemployed people and encouraged employers to hire workers. Participants were placed in subsidized positions with nonprofits, for-profit firms, and public agencies for a fixed time period, and their salaries were partially or fully subsidized. Florida’s Back to Work program, administered by the Agency for Workforce Innovation, placed participants in partially subsidized jobs in which the employers were expected to cover 5 to 20 percent of an employee’s wages. For-profit firms that participated were required to commit to keeping the employee after the subsidy period ended. Positions could last up to one year; however, the program lasted only six months and the duration of many positions was much shorter. All programs funded through EF ended in September 2010.","The study included five states, for which the authors conducted a pre-post analysis in which participants’ earnings and employment in the four quarters following completion of the program were compared with their outcomes in the four quarters before participating in the program. This type of analysis can describe the experiences of participants but cannot determine whether they were better off as a result of participating in the program.
The authors attempted a more rigorous analysis, which is the focus of this profile, of the EF subsidized employment programs in Florida. Officials provided data on a group of unemployed people who were eligible for the Back to Work program but never participated. The authors compared the employment and earnings outcomes of the group that was placed into subsidized jobs with the outcomes of the comparison group that was not placed into subsidized jobs, and tested for significant differences between the two groups. Data on participant characteristics were obtained from the Agency for Workforce Innovation; participants’ quarterly employment and earnings were collected from Florida’s Unemployment Insurance wage reporting system. The authors used 2009 as the pre-program period and 2011 as the post-program period.","The study found that the employment rates among Florida Back to Work participants were 23 percentage points higher than employment rates in the comparison group in the first quarter of 2011, and 5 to 7 percentage points higher than the comparison group in the following three quarters. Earnings were also higher in the program group than in the comparison group; however, it was not until the third quarter of 2011 that post-program earnings in the program group exceeded that group’s pre-program earnings.
Florida Back to Work participants earned $1,921 more, on average, in 2011 than those in the comparison group.","The analyses for each state in which participants’ earnings and employment in the four quarters following completion of the program were compared with those same participants’ outcomes in the four quarters before participating in the program can describe the experiences of participants, but cannot determine whether the participants were better off as a result of participating in the program. Thus, these analyses have low causal evidence.
For the more rigorous analysis in Florida, the study did not appear to statistically control for demographic characteristics or earnings measured more than 12 months before program participation in the calculation of impacts. These statistical controls are required to receive a moderate causal evidence rating, the highest rating possible for nonexperimental studies.","",""

The study was a randomized controlled trial; eligible SSDI recipients were randomly assigned to the treatment group, which was eligible for the benefit offset, or a control group that was not. The authors analyzed data from the Master Earnings File (MEF), Master Beneficiary Record (MBR), and Supplemental Security Record (SSR).
The study found that the BOND intervention had no significant impact on total earnings or total SSDI benefits paid over the eight-month follow-up period.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it is based on a well-conducted randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the effects estimated in the study are attributable solely to the BOND, and not to other factors.","Absence of conflict of interest: This study was conducted by staff from Mathematica Policy Research, which administers CLEAR. Therefore, the review of this study was conducted by an independent consultant trained in applying the CLEAR causal evidence guidelines.","Administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA), the BOND was designed to test variants of SSDI program rules to increase the incentive for SSDI recipients to work and reduce their reliance on benefits. The primary intervention was a benefit offset that replaced the so-called cash cliff SSDI recipients who work eventually experience. The cash cliff refers to the fact that SSDI recipients who have completed a nine-month trial work period followed by a grace period of three months have all their SSDI benefits suspended or terminated if they earn more than the substantial gainful activity (SGA) amount. The benefit offset replaces the complete loss of all benefits for working SSDI recipients, instead gradually decreasing the SSDI benefit by $1 for every $2 earned above the SGA amount. The Benefit Offset Pilot Demonstration (BOPD) pilot tested BOND in four states.","The BOND was evaluated using a randomized controlled trial including all SSDI recipients in 10 randomly selected sites throughout the nation who were ages 20 to 59 and receiving benefits payments in April 2011. All eligible recipients were randomly assigned to either a treatment group, which was eligible for the enhanced work incentives, or a control group, which received services as usual. This analysis sample included 968,713 subjects (77,115 in the treatment group and 891,598 in the control group).
The authors used multiple SSA administrative data sources to measure impacts: the MEF included annual earnings information, the MBR provided SSDI participation information, and the SSR provided Supplemental Security Income (SSI) participation information.","The study found that the BOND had no significant impact on employment rates, earnings, or total SSDI benefits paid over the eight-month follow-up period.","This report covered impacts measured over an eight-month follow-up period. The authors attributed the lack of statistically significant findings to the relatively short period for treatment subjects to receive notification of their enrollment, learn about the benefit offset, and adjust their employment behaviors accordingly, and the requirement that treatment subjects completed a trial work period and grace period—which took at least 12 months—before they could use the benefit offset.","Alabama

The study compared outcomes for students who participated in the Early Colleges’ admissions lotteries and were offered enrollment with the outcomes for students who participated in the lotteries but were not offered enrollment.
The study found that Early Colleges had positive and statistically significant effects on high school and college achievement.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to being offered admission in an Early College, and not to other factors.","","The Early College High School Initiative exposed underserved students to college and provided support in attending college and earning college credit while in high school. By partnering with colleges and universities, the initiative offered all students an opportunity to earn an associate’s degree or up to two years of college credits toward a bachelor’s degree during high school at little or no cost to the students. Services provided varied across Early Colleges, but all Early Colleges provided tutoring and information on accessing, financing, and preparing for college. Some Early Colleges offered summer, weekend, or evening courses and some had block schedules or extended school days. Of the 10 Early Colleges examined in this study, 8 were located on college campuses.","The study included 10 Early Colleges: 5 in urban areas, 2 in mid-sized cities, and 3 in small towns. Average student enrollment was 290, with the smallest at 100 students and the largest more than 600. These Early Colleges had more students who wanted admission than available slots and therefore used lotteries to allocate their slots. The study sample included 2,458 students: 1,044 were randomly granted admission to an Early College and 1,414 (the control group) were not offered admission to Early College. Slightly more than half the students were minorities, about a third were the first generation in their families to attend college, and about 45 percent were from low-income households.
The authors used data from school records, student surveys, and the National Student Clearinghouse to compare the academic outcomes of students who won admission to an Early College with those of students who were not offered admission, adjusting for baseline characteristics of the students.","The study found that admission to an Early College had statistically significant impacts on a number of high school and college achievement and attainment outcomes. In high school, Early College students had higher English language arts achievement than students not admitted to Early Colleges (standardized score average of 0.37 versus 0.23), and were 5 percentage points more likely to graduate from high school (86 versus 81 percent).
For college, 80 percent of Early College students had at least one record of college enrollment, compared with 71 percent of comparison students, and 51 percent of Early College students enrolled in a four-year college after high school, compared with 46 percent in the control group.
By the end of the follow-up period, 22 percent of Early College students earned a postsecondary degree, including a certificate, associate’s degree, or bachelor’s degree, compared with 2 percent of comparison students.","There was a statistically significant difference in prior achievement in English language arts between students in the treatment and control groups. The researchers believed this was due to chance and included a control variable for this difference in their model.","",""

The authors summarized evidence from existing studies, organized around three main types of influences on decision making: psychological (perceived self-competence, goals, and interests); socialization (societal and cultural beliefs that shape an individual’s belief and value systems); and biological (hormonal and genetic factors).
The authors found evidence of psychological influences on women’s participation in STEM careers, including women preferring more people-oriented jobs than STEM careers typically provide, and women leaving more intensive STEM careers after having children because of their work–family preferences. In terms of socialization influences, the authors found evidence of the importance of school factors, including teachers’ instructional practices, the structure of schools or classrooms, and teachers’ abilities to forge positive relationships with students, in influencing female students’ interest and abilities in STEM fields. In addition, the study highlighted evidence that values, belief systems, and family support can influence girls’ interest and success in STEM fields.
The study noted that other studies have found biological differences in terms of hormone production and brain organization between men and women, but that these differences have not conclusively been linked to any behavior or ability levels in men and women.","","","","","","",""

The study was based on a randomized controlled trial and estimated the effect of the Family Rewards program on low-income families. The authors used New York City and New York State administrative data to compare average outcomes between families offered access to the program and families excluded from the program, after adjusting for chance initial differences between the groups.
The authors found that, on average, the Family Rewards program decreased the likelihood of ever being employed at an Unemployment Insurance (UI)-covered job in the first year by 2 percentage points, but increased monthly earnings by $353 and decreased the share of families receiving income from Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or disability benefits by 3.9 percentage points. The authors also found that parents in the Family Rewards program group were 4.2 percentage points more likely to have achieved any trade license training certification.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high for most outcomes because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Family Rewards program, and not to other factors. However, some outcomes in the study receive a moderate or low causal evidence rating, meaning that we are less confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Family Rewards program; other factors may have contributed.","","Family Rewards was a conditional cash transfer program that tied cash rewards to prespecified activities and outcomes in children’s education, families’ preventive health care, and parents’ employment. The program was created by private foundations and community-based organizations in New York City to test this type of program’s effect in a developed-country context. Cash assistance was offered to reduce immediate hardship and to build human capital to reduce poverty over the long-term. Participants could receive cash incentives if they met required conditions, including education-focused conditions such as school attendance, achievement levels on standardized tests, and engagement with students’ education; health-focused conditions such as maintaining health insurance coverage for parents and their children; and workforce-focused conditions aimed at parents, such as maintaining full-time work and participating in approved education and job-training activities. The program was scheduled to last three years.","From July 2007 to January 2008, a total of 4,790 families were randomly assigned to a group that could participate in the Family Rewards program or to a control group that was not offered the incentives. Families eligible for the study were living in selected New York City community districts; had incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level; had at least one child in the 4th, 7th, or 9th grade; and composed only of legal residents of the United States. The authors compared outcomes between these two groups after adjusting for chance differences in the characteristics of the groups.","The study found that, on average, the Family Rewards program decreased the likelihood of ever being employed at a UI-covered job in the first year by 2.4 percentage points.
The study also found that, on average, the Family Rewards program increased household income in the month before the 42-month survey by $353 and decreased the share of families who received income from SSI or disability benefits by 3.9 percentage points.
Access to the Family Rewards program was associated with higher likelihoods of achieving any trade license or training certification by 4.2 percentage points. (This outcome received a moderate evidence rating because, although many participants were missing data on this outcome, the authors controlled statistically for all the variables that the CLEAR protocol requires for a moderate rating.","The study authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to employment, income, public benefit receipt, and education. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.
Outcomes other than those reported above under the Findings section received a low evidence rating because enough participants were missing data on the outcomes that differences between the treatment and comparison group members who responded might have been driven by factors that determined response, not the Family Rewards program.The authors did not control statistically for all the variables that the CLEAR protocol requires for a moderate rating. This review was conducted in collaboration with the Employment Strategies for Low-Income Adults Evidence Review (ESER). Because ESER did not report findings for studies that received a low causal evidence rating, the CLEAR profile does not report the otherwise eligible, low-rating findings either.","",""

The study was a randomized controlled trial. Eligible students (369 in total) were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which could participate in the GED Bridge program, or the control group, which could not participate in the GED Bridge program but could participate in a traditional GED preparation course.
The study found that, compared with students randomly assigned to the traditional GED Prep course, those offered enrollment in the GED Bridge to Health and Business program were more likely to complete the GED course, pass the GED exam within a year, enroll in a City University of New York (CUNY) community college by the end of the study, and reenroll for a second semester at a CUNY community college by the end of the study.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the GED Bridge to Health and Business program, and not to other factors.","","LaGuardia Community College of the City University of New York system developed the GED Bridge to Health and Business program to help New York City residents without a high school diploma or equivalent to succeed on the GED exam and encourage them to continue on to higher education. The program featured 108 hours of classroom instruction following a specially designed curriculum oriented toward careers in health care and business and taught by a full-time instructor who was paid for both class and preparation time. Students in the program received in-class and individualized counseling and had access to general college resources. The GED Bridge program lasted 12 weeks.","New Yorkers ages 18 and older with incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty line and no high school diploma or GED were eligible to apply to participate; applicants who subsequently scored at or above a 7th-grade reading level on the Test for Adult Basic Education (TABE) in mathematics and reading were eligible to participate in the study. The study enrolled 369 applicants, although this analysis is based on outcomes for 276 participants, because the data for the last cohort of participants was not available at the time of writing.
Eligible students were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the treatment group was enrolled tuition-free in LaGuardia Community College’s GED Bridge to Health and Business program and the control group was enrolled tuition-free in a traditional GED preparation course modeled on LaGuardia Community College’s established, tuition-funded GED program. The traditional program featured 60 hours of classroom instruction following a standard GED textbook taught by an adjunct instructor who was paid for in-class time, but not preparation time. Students in the control group had access to general college resources, but received no additional counseling.
Students in the study had an average age of 26.6 years. Two-thirds (67.2 percent) were female, 50.1 percent were Hispanic, and 34.5 percent were non-Hispanic African American. More than half (53.4 percent) reported receiving public assistance, and 15.2 percent reported that the highest grade they had attained was 9th grade or below. One-third (33.6 percent) of participants scored at the 10th-grade level or above on the TABE, and 50.1 percent scored at the 7th- or 8th-grade level.
The authors estimated the effect of the GED Bridge program by comparing the means of treatment and control group members on outcomes of interest, controlling for demographic characteristics.","The study found that, compared with students assigned to a traditional GED prep course, those offered enrollment in the GED Bridge to Health and Business program were 27.1 percentage points more likely to complete the GED course and 30.4 percentage points more likely to pass the GED exam within a year.
In addition, students in the treatment group were 17.0 percentage points more likely, or more than three times as likely, to enroll in a CUNY community college by the end of the study and 8.9 percentage points more likely, or more than four times as likely, to reenroll for a second semester at a CUNY community college by the end of the study.","The GED Bridge program had multiple components and it is not possible to determine which of them were responsible for the program impacts. For instance, the quality of staff delivering the curricula likely varied across conditions, because instructors taught the GED Bridge program and were paid for preparation time, whereas adjuncts taught the traditional GED program and were not paid for preparation time. Thus, teacher quality and preparation time were included in the estimate of the program’s effects. In other words, implementing the program without this (or another) component might not yield the same results.","",""

The objective was to contribute to the knowledge base on gender issues in academic professions and the specific challenges that working mothers in STEM fields face.
The study used data from the 2011 Faculty Caregiving and Workplace and Culture survey administered online to about 300 tenure-line faculty members in all disciplines at a large public U.S. university. The author conducted regression analyses to estimate the link between faculty members’ sex, parental status, academic discipline, and their level of agreement with the statement, “My job requires me to work very hard.” The regression controlled for several factors that might affect faculty members’ perceptions of how hard they have to work at their job, such as length of time at current institution, academic rank, perceived job demand levels, feelings of being valued, marital status, age of children, household/family responsibilities, and degree to which household responsibilities are perceived to affect job performance.
The study found that mothers in STEM fields were more likely to strongly agree that they have to work very hard at their job, compared to fathers in both STEM and non-STEM fields and mothers in non-STEM fields, after controlling for a number of factors related to perceptions of effort required. Specifically, fathers in STEM and non-STEM fields were 84 percent and 92 percent less likely, respectively, to strongly agree that they have to work very hard at their job than mothers in STEM fields. Similarly, mothers in non-STEM fields were about 81 percent less likely than mothers in STEM fields to agree that they have to work very hard at their job.","","","","","","",""

The primary data source for this study was New York State administrative data. The author conducted an instrumental variables analysis and a propensity score matching analysis.
Weekly earnings for individuals who received benefits and work incentives counseling were higher than earnings among nonrecipients, with differences estimated between 40 and 31 percent by instrumental variables analysis, and between 12.5 and 10.9 percent by propensity score matching. The effect of benefits and work incentives counseling on case closure was estimated to be positive under both methods but was not statistically significant.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is moderate. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the counseling, but other factors might also have contributed.","","The VR program is designed to provide people with disabilities with the supports and services needed to achieve their employment goals. Although the federal government provides the majority of VR funding, the program is administered at the state level. The services provided to a VR client typically vary based on the client’s disability, the client’s employment goals, and other factors. VR services may include, but are not limited to, general employment counseling, skill evaluations, job referrals, and vocational training1. Because VR programs are charged with serving those with the most severe disabilities and Social Security disability benefits are given to those who meet strict medical eligibility criteria, many VR clients are also Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit recipients.","The study examined the effect of participation in VR benefits and work incentives counseling services in New York State between 2003 and 2009 among SSDI and SSI recipients. In New York, the VR benefits and work incentives counseling incorporates a range of services that culminate in personalized employment support as well as personalized information on the effect earnings will have on the client’s SSDI or SSI eligibility.
The author used two methodological strategies—instrumental variable analysis and propensity score matching—to control for possible intrinsic differences between the population of VR participants who received benefits and work incentives counseling and those who did not. Using the estimated propensity score and a caliper of 0.001, each treatment subject was matched to at least two comparison group members. Matching was done without replacement. For the instrumental variable analysis, the instrument chosen to identify the services’ causal effect was the percentage of each VR district office’s clients who did not receive benefits and work incentives counseling services.
Of 38,195 SSDI or SSI recipients who were VR clients between 2003 and 2009, only 622 were eligible for and received benefits and work incentives counseling. To conduct the analysis, the author gathered administrative data on weekly earnings, the number of working hours, and SSDI or SSI benefit receipt from VR case closures from New York State’s Adult Career and Continuing Education Services Case Administration Management System.","Benefits and work incentives counseling increased SSI/SSDI receipients' weekly earnings by 12.5 percent and working hours by 10.9 percent, based on a propensity score matching of counseled and not counseled recipients. Estimating the same quantities by instrumental variables analysis increases the effect of counseling to 40 and 31 percent, respectively.
Receipients who received counseling were 11.7 percent more likely to be employed when their VR case was closed, based on propensity score matching, but this change is not statistically significant.
Simulated results obtained by manipulating the instrumental variable suggest that increasing the availability of benefits and work incentives counseling to 10 percent of SSI/SSDI recepients statewide could increase recipients’ weekly earnings by $10 per week, leading to an approximate yearly increase of $1 million in New York State tax revenues.","When performing propensity score matching, a technique designed to create a control group as similar to the intervention group as possible on all background characteristics, the author restricted the pool of potential comparison units to SSI/SSDI recepients categorized as successfully rehabilitated by October 2009. Excluding recepients who had not completed their rehabilitation by this time may have biased the estimated effect of counseling on employment metrics.","New York State VR offices.","1ACCES-VR.

The goal of the workshops—which included hands-on activities and discussions of engineering theory, examples, and careers—was to familiarize girls with engineering and depict it as a profession in which communal goals are central, which research shows that women value more than men.
The authors asked female students in grades 5 and 6 to draw and write about an engineer (the Draw an Engineer Test [DAET]) before and after they attended the workshops. The DAET was analyzed for the engineer’s characteristics, such as gender, work activity, and themes (for example, teamwork). The students also completed feedback forms at the end of the program.
The authors found that by the end of the workshops, students were more likely to draw and describe engineers as women and happy as compared with the pre-program assessment in which the students often depicted engineers as car mechanics. Participants also referenced communal goals more frequently in the follow-up assessment.
Participants reported in feedback forms a preference for hands-on activities over interactive discussions.","","","","","","",""

The study sample included SSDI recipients who entered the rolls from July 1999 to October 2003, were ages 18 to 39, and were not concurrently receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI). The authors used data from the Ticket Research File (TRF), a Social Security administrative data file, for the analysis.
The study found that TTW did not have a statistically significant impact on SSDI return to work earnings benchmarks or the number of SSDI recipients who had their benefits suspended or terminated due to work.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this report is moderate, the highest possible rating for a nonexperimental study. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to TTW, but other factors might have contributed.","Absence of conflict of interest: This study was conducted by staff from Mathematica Policy Research, which administers CLEAR. Therefore, the review of this study was conducted by an independent consultant trained in applying the CLEAR causal evidence guidelines.","The TTW program aimed to improve employment outcomes for people with disabilities by providing SSI and SSDI recipients with an enhanced menu of employment services. Recipients older than 18 received a ticket by mail entitling them to free employment services through local employment networks (ENs) or state vocational rehabilitation agencies (SVRAs), organizations that offer job search assistance, career counseling, and other employment services. Using the ticket was voluntary. To encourage service receipt and, ultimately, gainful employment, SSA offered ENs and SVRAs reimbursement incentives tied to the progress their ticket holders made toward employment.
The TTW program operated within a larger set of SSDI and SSI return-to-work incentives and earnings benchmarks. SSDI recipients may engage in a trial work period (TWP), which allows them to test their ability to work for up to 9 months over a nonconsecutive, rolling 60-month period without penalty. In 2014, a month counts toward a TWP if the recipient’s earnings that month exceed $770. After a TWP and the 3-month grace period that immediately follows it are completed, the recipient enters a 36-month continuous extended period of eligibility. If a recipient’s monthly earnings exceed the substantial gainful activity (SGA) amount during that period, SSDI benefits are suspended that month, though the benefits can be reinstated in the subsequent month if the subsequent month’s earnings are below the SGA amount. Earning above the SGA amount after the extended period of eligibility results in SSDI benefit termination.","Although all SSDI and SSI recipients are eligible for the TTW program, the study sample was confined to a subpopulation of SSDI recipients considered relatively more likely to work than most SSDI recipients—those ages 18 to 39 who entered the rolls from July 1999 to October 2003 and were not concurrently receiving SSI benefits.
The outcomes for this analysis were measured using the 2007 release of the TRF, which contains historical information on more than 22 million Social Security disability benefit recipients. For more than 77,000 recipients, the authors used the TRF to measure TWP initiation, TWP completion, having SSDI benefits suspended or terminated for work in any of the 48 follow-up months, and number of months in nonpayment status after having SSDI benefits suspended or terminated for work. The analysis period spanned 1999 through 2007.
The authors exploited the random variation in the ticket mailing date to estimate program impacts. SSA mailed tickets to SSDI recipients based on the last digit of the recipients’ Social Security number—essentially creating random variation in the mailing date. This random variation enabled the authors to examine whether having a later ticket mailing date led to statistically significantly different outcomes during fixed time intervals. The authors also estimated models using the predicted—rather than actual—month of the mailing because not all tickets were mailed according to schedule. The regressions controlled for differences in the sample members’ demographic, background, and disability-related characteristics.","The study found that 48 months after being mailed a ticket, the TTW program did not increase employment and earnings enough to increase the number of those who initiated or completed a TWP or increase the number of SSDI recipients who had their benefits suspended or terminated due to work.","A critical assumption of the evaluation design is that the random variation in exposure to treatment, in this case the month the notification letter was mailed, is the only systematic change that could be responsible for differences in behavior. The authors conducted a number of sensitivity checks to conclude this assumption was valid. In addition, they included control variables to adjust for differences in the groups of sample members defined by the months in which the ticket was mailed.","",""

The study considered both the complexity of the mother’s occupation when her children were ages 6 to 13 as well as the complexity of her occupation in her children’s earliest years (birth to age 3).
The authors analyzed data from the 1984–1996 Panel Study of Income Dynamics and its 1997 Child Development Supplement to determine the relationship between maternal occupational complexity and children’s scores on the Revised Woodcock-Johnson Test of Achievement. The analysis first accounted for traits associated with mothers’ employment status, that is, whether the mother was employed. Assuming the mother was employed, the authors then assessed the association between the complexity of the mother’s occupation and her children’s performance on the reading and math sections of the test.
The study found that a one-point increase on the maternal white collar occupational complexity scale was associated with a 2.49-point increase in children’s test scores, whereas a one-point increase on the blue collar occupational complexity scale corresponded to a 1.01-point gain in test scores.
Maternal occupational complexity during the child’s first three years also was associated with increased test scores later in life; a one-point gain in white collar occupational complexity in the first three years of the child’s life was associated with a 3.7-point increase in test scores when the child was ages 6 to 13.","","","","","","",""

The authors also considered whether employment in STEM occupations varied by gender.
The authors surveyed 1,490 people drawn from a national longitudinal study in the United States—once in 1992 when the respondents were in 12th grade and again in 2007 when the respondents were 33 years old—to ask about occupation type. They also collected math and verbal Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) scores for these people, as well as the number of high school mathematics courses taken and parental reports of parental education and family income. The authors used regression analyses of longitudinal survey data and other descriptive statistical techniques.
The study found that students’ high school math and verbal abilities predicted whether they worked in a STEM field at age 33. Of those with moderate verbal and high math abilities, 49 percent worked in a STEM job at age 33, whereas only 34 percent of those with both high verbal and math abilities worked in a STEM job. Though more women were in the high math and high verbal abilities group than men, the likelihood of someone with both high math and verbal abilities choosing to work in a STEM occupation did not vary by gender but did vary by the individual’s self-perception on abilities in math in 12th grade.
The authors argued that people with high math and high verbal abilities could find a wider variety of jobs that fit their skill sets, which might explain why fewer of those in this group pursued STEM careers than those with high math but moderate verbal abilities.","","","","","","",""

The study used course-administered assessments to compare the math competency and attitudes about math of students before and after participation in the Accelerate summer program.
The authors found that students (both male and female) who participated in the Accelerate program had higher math competency and less anxiety about math after completing the program, compared with their competency and anxiety measured before enrollment in the program.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Accelerate New Mexico Math Camp program; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The Accelerate New Mexico Math Camp operated at six public northern New Mexico community colleges and was one component of a four-fold program to support traditionally underrepresented students’ pursuit of careers in STEM fields. It was an intensive eight-week summer program that covered the content of several remedial math classes in a single semester and included a robotics component. Successful completion of the Accelerate New Mexico Math Camp enabled students to move on to college-level math and science courses that are often required for majors in STEM fields. Students received a stipend to attend the program. The report evaluated only the Accelerate New Mexico Math Camp, not the entire Accelerate program. Accelerate also provided students with support from technical career advisors and coordinated professional readiness events and helped students secure internships and jobs in STEM-related fields.","Students volunteered to participate in the Accelerate New Mexico Math Camp, and the study included all 55 program participants at the six sites. Females accounted for 60 percent of the students, 66 percent were Hispanic, and 27 percent were white. The average age was 27.
The authors estimated regression and other statistical models comparing the outcomes of students before and after they participated in the Accelerate New Mexico Math Camp. The models controlled for participants’ demographics (age, gender, and ethnicity); participants’ experiences (data from students on their opinions of teacher effectiveness, tutor effectiveness, the robotics curriculum, and the format and pace of the curriculum); and length of time each student spent using the course’s self-paced software program.","Students in the study significantly improved their math competency from 22 percent of students who were competent at the beginning of the program to 64 percent at the end.
Students’ attitudes toward math, as measured by self-reported math efficacy and anxiety, also significantly improved by 10 percent from the beginning to the end of the program.
Both of these results were true for men and women, but there was no statistically significant difference in the magnitude of the outcomes by gender.","The authors compared the outcomes of participants measured before and after they participated in the Accelerate New Mexico Math Camp; there was no comparison group that did not participate in the program and could represent what might have occurred had the people who chose to participate in the camp not enrolled in it. For study designs of this type,. CLEAR’s guidelines require that the authors observe outcomes for multiple periods before the intervention to rule out the possibility that participants had increasing or decreasing trends in the outcomes examined before enrollment in the program. That is, if students who had increasing math competency or attitudes tended to enroll in the program, we would anticipate further increases over time, even if they did not participate in the program. Without knowing the trends before program enrollment, we cannot rule this out.","",""

The authors conducted semistructured interviews in 2009–2010 with 10 science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) faculty members (7 women and 3 men) at a Midwestern university. The interviews aimed to study the barriers STEM faculty face in using the university’s parental leave policy. The authors analyzed these data using a variety of qualitative coding techniques.
The study found that faculty under-used the university’s parental leave policy for several reasons. First, the opinions of their department chairs and their peers often shaped faculty’s willingness to take parental leave. If faculty felt that their department heads, fellow faculty members, laboratory personnel, and students were supportive of parental leave policies, they were more willing to participate, because they felt less pressure to maintain their typical teaching and research workload after having a child. Additionally, the authors suggested that both knowledge of the parental leave policy and understanding of what was covered, among both the faculty themselves and their supervisors and administrators, was important to ensure that the policy was applied correctly in each specific case.

The study also briefly summarized other gender equity trends in CTE and STEM fields, including why women choose to not work in CTE and STEM fields and how gender disparities in various industries can be detrimental to society at large.
The author found that the Perkins Act and its various reauthorizations had aimed to improve female participation in nontraditional career fields, but lack of funds limited the legislation’s influence. The author also identified additional factors influencing women’s career choices—including gender-role socialization, socioeconomic status, parents’ education level and expectations for their daughters, and advice from guidance counselors—as perpetuating gender disparities in these fields.

The study was a randomized controlled trial. Eligible male youth from 18 public schools in disadvantaged neighborhoods were screened for eligibility. The 2,740 who met requirements were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups or a control group.
The study found that being offered the opportunity to participate in the program reduced violent crime arrests during the program year and improved schooling outcomes in both the program and follow-up years.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Becoming a Man program, and not to other factors.","","Conducted by Youth Guidance and World Sport Chicago, two local nonprofit organizations, Becoming a Man used cognitive behavioral therapy principles to attempt to reduce violence and dropout among disadvantaged youth. Through in- and after-school programming and regular exposure to prosocial adults, students were taught to recognize situations in which automatic responses could lead to trouble and to correct those responses accordingly.
The in-school component offered up to 27 one-hour, once-per-week group sessions during the school day over the school year. Students skipped an academic class in order to participate in the program, which is one of the incentives for many youth to attend. The sessions were delivered in small groups and with low student-to-staff ratios to help develop relationships.
The after-school component kept youth occupied during the hours immediately after the end of school, which can be a high-risk time for engaging in suboptimal behaviors. In addition, coaches led one- to two-hour sessions on nontraditional sports, such as archery and martial arts, which provided opportunities for youth to practice cognitive behavioral therapy principles.","The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted in Chicago in school year 2009–2010. The study authors recruited 18 public elementary (which serve grades K–8) and high schools in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods in the city to participate. They began by identifying all male students (3,669 people) who were expected to attend those schools and be enrolled in grades 7–10 during school year 2009–2010. A few students (268) were excluded from the study because they missed more than 60 percent of days during the previous academic year and received a failing grade in at least 75 percent of their courses; another 294 students with serious conditions including autism, speech and language disabilities, traumatic brain injury, and emotional and behavioral disorders were also excluded.
The remaining 2,740 students were ranked on the basis of a risk index. The authors then calculated the number of students needed in each school for the study sample, selected that many students in descending order on their risk index, and randomized those selected students to one of four conditions: in-school only, after-school only, both in-school and after-school, or the control group. The authors combined the first three (treatment) groups for analysis. The control group could not participate in the Becoming a Man program.
The authors used electronic arrest records from the Illinois State Police, matched to the analysis sample using probabilistic matching on name and date of birth, to measure criminal justice outcomes and administrative records from the Chicago Public Schools for academic outcomes during the program year and a follow-up year.","The study found that being offered the program reduced violent crime arrests by four per 100 youth during the program year. However, there were no statistically significant impacts on nonviolent, nonproperty, or nondrug crimes during the program year.
The effect on violent crime arrests did not persist into the follow-up year.
Being offered the program led to lasting gains in an index of schooling outcomes equal to 0.06 standard deviations in the program year and 0.08 in the follow-up year.","About half of the youth assigned to one of the treatment groups participated. Among those who participated at all, the average participant attended 13 of the possible 27 one- to two-hour sessions. Therefore, the estimated impacts (which calculated the effect of being offered the program) likely understated the impact of actually participating in the program.
Because of this, the authors also estimated impacts of participating in the treatment on outcomes. However, such an analysis introduces the possibility that certain types of youth might have chosen to participate and might also have had better outcomes absent participation; for example, they might have had greater motivation, which spurred them to participate and improved their outcomes. Therefore, that analysis of participants cannot receive a high causal evidence rating. This review focuses only on the results for the offer to participate in the program, which receives a high causal evidence rating.","",""

Better information on the backgrounds, impairments, personal characteristics, and employment outcomes of these recipients would help policymakers develop programs tailored to the needs and circumstances of various subgroups of such recipients.
This study used administrative data on young SSD awardees first awarded benefits from 1996 to 2007 to examine trends in their composition and outcomes. Most of the data come from the 2009 version of the Disability Analysis File, a data file originally constructed to support analysis of the effects of the Ticket to Work program.
The study found that the composition of young SSD awardees changed substantially during this period. It also found that young awardees differed from older SSD awardees along many dimensions other than age.
The findings raised several important policy issues. Most important, policymakers have to consider other options for the support of youth and young adults with disabilities—options that do not discourage work while promoting dependence.","","","","","","",""

The study found that the female faculty were generally dissatisfied with formal mentoring relationships and instead sought mentors on their own. Faculty selected these informal mentors from among those with whom they had an existing relationship, such as a friend or co-committee member. Mentees selected multiple mentors with mixed backgrounds and characteristics to serve different purposes (for example, discussing work-life balance or career advancement) and mentees typically had at least one mentor outside of the department or university to discuss more confidential matters.

The authors used statistical analysis to compare the earnings and employment outcomes of WIA-registered low-income adults who received training services to the outcomes of those who were registered in WIA but did not receive training services.
The study found that total earnings in the third year after WIA registration were significantly higher for the treatment group than the comparison group. Individuals in the treatment group earned $1,257 and $1,703 more than those in the comparison group in State A and State B, respectively.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it was based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design; this is the highest causal evidence rating possible for a nonexperimental design. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the training services received, but other factors might also have contributed.","","The WIA adult program training services involved classes in occupational skills and on-the-job training provided by private firms. Selection into the training services could have occurred in a variety of ways, including referral from a training provider or program staff member, individual choice, or natural progression through prior services offered by WIA. There were no specific eligibility criteria for registering in the WIA program itself.","The study implemented a nonexperimental analysis of the employment and earnings of WIA adult program participants in two states. State A, a medium sized state located on the East Coast, had 15,532 WIA adult program participants of whom 4,640 received the training services. State B, a large state located in the Midwest, had 23,182 WIA adult program participants of whom 11,380 received training services. Using data from the Workforce Investment Act Standard Record Data (WIASRD) and Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD), the authors used a statistical technique (regression analysis using inverse propensity weighting) that compared the treatment group of participants who received training services to the comparison group of participants who did not receive training services. The comparison group was selected to match the treatment group in terms of demographic characteristics and prior employment and earnings.","In State A, the treatment group earned significantly less in the first three quarters and was significantly less likely to be employed in the first two quarters after WIA registration than those in the comparison group.
Similarly, in State B, the treatment group earned significantly less in the first four quarters and was significantly less likely to be employed in the first three quarters after WIA registration than the comparison group.
From quarters 6 through 12 after WIA registration, earnings and employment were significantly higher in every quarter for the treatment group in State A compared to the comparison group, with the exception of the quarter 8 in which employment was higher but the difference was not statistically significant.
In State B, earnings and employment were higher for the treatment group than for the comparison group in every quarter starting in quarters 6 and 4 after WIA registration, respectively.
Treatment group members in State A and State B earned $1,257 and $1,703 more, respectively, in the third year after WIA registration than those in the comparison group.","The program was designed such that WIA participants would receive core and intensive services, followed by training if they were still not employed. However, in practice, some participants received training without receiving core or intensive services. Thus, the treatment in this study can be understood as training plus the opportunity to receive core and intensive services, whereas the comparison condition is the opportunity to receive core and intensive services only.","",""

The authors randomly assigned 48 female undergraduates to receive one of four verbal messages from an advisor about their ability to succeed in a fictitious master’s program in eco-psychology; the women also received a printed brochure distributed to all study groups. The messages varied in terms of emphasis placed on students’ ability versus level of effort. Specifically, three of the message groups conveyed that student success depended on (1) their natural ability (natural ability group), (2) putting in more effort than peers (more effort group), or (3) putting in the same high level of effort as peers (normal effort group). The advisors did not discuss effort requirements with the fourth group that served as a control group (the no information group). Students then immediately completed a questionnaire measuring self-doubt, perceived confidence, future interest in eco-psychology, and how well they thought they would fit into the program.
The study found that students in the normal effort group exhibited a significantly higher sense of academic belonging to and future interest in the eco-psychology program than the other three groups. They also had higher perceived competence compared with the more effort group and exhibited lower self-doubt than the no information and more effort groups.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not include sufficient controls in their analysis to account for differences between each group, which is required of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with high attrition.

All participants received the same brochure that presented the program as male-dominated, using mainly photographs of men and male faculty names, and were asked to complete a career inventory to share with a program advisor. All students were then told they were good candidates and would likely succeed, but were randomly assigned to receive one of four supplemental messages: (1) they would have to rely on their natural ability (natural ability group); (2) they would have to put in a lot more effort than other students (more effort group); (3) they would have to put in a lot of effort, just like everyone else (normal effort group); or (4) no additional information was provided (no information group). After receiving the message, students immediately completed a questionnaire measuring self-doubt, perceived confidence, future interest in eco-psychology, and how well they thought they would fit into the program. The authors compared responses between each of the four groups using separate one-way analyses of variance for each outcome measure.","Students in the normal effort group exhibited a significantly higher sense of academic belonging (ranging from 0.64 to 0.86 higher on a 5-point scale) and future interest in the eco-psychology program (from 22.59 to 30.00 percentage points) over any other group. They also had higher perceived competence (1.36 points on a 7-point scale) than the more effort group and lower self-doubt (0.84 and 0.71 points, respectively, on a 6-point scale) than the no information and more effort groups.","Information contained in the study suggests that not all randomly assigned students were included in all analyses, but we were not able to reach the authors to determine from which groups students were dropped. Due to small sample sizes and without knowing from which groups students were dropped, CLEAR must assume high differential attrition and consider the study quasi-experimental. In a quasi-experimental study, the authors must account for baseline differences between the treatment and comparison groups on measureable characteristics that could affect the outcomes of interest. The authors in this study did not control for any such differences between the groups due to the empirical approach used.
Given the multiple study groups, a large number of comparisons were made regarding attitudes toward STEM. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect actual group differences. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests conducted, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","",""

The quality of causal evidence presented in this report under the DID design is low. The RDD does not receive a causal rating.","Absence of conflict of interest.","PANES was a government funded program that started in 2005 and lasted for 34 months. Uruguay is a middle income country with higher school attendance rates and lower child labor rates than other Latin America countries that have used conditional cash transfer programs to increase school enrollment and decrease child labor. The PANES program provided a monthly lump sum cash payment (equivalent to ~$56 USD) to eligible households, regardless of the number of children in the household. Households with pregnant women and children could also receive a food card. Minor program components included a workfare program, job training, adult educational interventions, and healthcare subsidies. By design, the cash transfers were conditional on children being enrolled in school and attending regular health check-ups, but in practice the conditions were not enforced and survey data indicated only 58 percent of the recipients were aware of the conditions. The targeted population was households in the bottom quintile of the national poverty line which represented about 8 percent of the population; but all low income households were invited to apply. Households with income below $50 USD were eligible and ultimately about 14 percent of the population received the program.","The authors used a regression discontinuity and a difference-in-differences (DID) design. After determining eligibility, 188,671 households were given the baseline survey and assigned a score based on socioeconomic factors. Those with scores higher than the cutoff score (indicating higher predicted poverty) received the program. The study sample was restricted to households whose applications were evaluated between September 2005 and April 2006. The analyses are based on PANES administrative data (baseline) and household survey data (two waves of follow-up). The first follow-up occurred 18 months into the program and the second wave two months after the program ended. At baseline, 79% of the children in beneficiary households attended school and 11% participated in child labor. In non-beneficiary households, 79% of children attended school and 15% participated in child labor. For the main regression discontinuity design, the sample size was 3,000 households within two percent of the cutoff score. The sample included 2,000 eligible households and 1,000 ineligible households. At the initial follow-up survey, nonresponse was 30%, so households were replaced in the sample with households with the same or similar scores. At the second follow-up the response rate was 92%. The secondary approach was a difference in difference design comparing the differential in the treatment and comparison group after the intervention.","Employment/Child labor
Neither the RDD nor the DID designs found any statistically significant relationship between PANES and child labor in either the first or second wave of follow-up.
Statistically significant relationships between PANES and child labor were not found either when examining age-divided or gender-divided subgroups.

Evidence from a randomized experiment","The study’s objective was to examine the impact of a conditional cash transfer program, called Pantawid Pamilya Pilipino Program (Pantawid) on child work participation and hours children worked per week.
Using household survey data from a randomized controlled trial, the authors analyzed the impact of the Pantawid program on child work participation almost 24-months after implementation.
The study found that there were no significant relationships between participation in the program and child work participation or hours worked per week.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because it based on a randomized controlled trial with unknown attrition and the authors did not control for pre-existing differences. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to Pantawid; other factors are likely to have contributed. However, the study did not find statistically significant effects.","Absence of Conflict of Interest.","The Pantawid Pamilya Pilipino Program (Pantawid) was a conditional cash transfer program that aimed to improve the social welfare of families in areas such as child education, health, and child labor. Households were eligible to participate if they had a child aged 0-14 and/or a woman who was pregnant, and if they were considered poor based on a set of household characteristics related to income. To receive the full cash transfer, mothers and/or their spouse needed to participate in family development sessions, any children aged 0-5 and pregnant women needed to receive healthcare, and any children aged 6-14 needed to regularly attend school and obtain deworming treatments. The amount of the cash transfer was equivalent to $11 USD per month for each household if they met the health and family development participation conditions, and an additional $6.50 per month for 10 months for each child aged 6-14 (up to three children) that met the education participation conditions.","The study used survey data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The RCT took place in the Philippines in four provinces: Lanao del Norte, Negros Oriental, Occidental Mindoro, and Mountain Province. The original study randomly assigned 130 Barangays, which are small regional areas, to the treatment and control groups. The study sample included 1,418 households that met eligibility criteria, with about half who lived in the treatment areas (n=714) and about half who lived in the control areas (n=704). A survey was used to measure household characteristics and outcomes and was administered almost two years after treatment households began to participate in the program. Eligible households in the treatment group were able to receive the conditional cash transfers. Eligible households in the control group could not receive the transfer until at least after the survey was administered. After that, they could potentially participate as the program expanded. Regression analyses were used to compare child labor outcomes between the treatment and control groups. Analysis of child labor outcomes included 3,098 school-aged children (6-17 years old) across the treatment and control groups.","Employment/Child labor 
The study did not find a significant difference in the proportion of children aged 6-17 that worked for pay between the treatment (8%) and control group (7%).
The study also did not find a significant difference in the number of hours children aged 6-17 worked per week between the treatment (17 hours) and the control group (17 hours).","The study used data from a randomized controlled trial with unknown attrition. In cases of high or unknown attrition, a study can receive a moderate causal evidence rating if the analysis controls for possible differences in background characteristics of the treatment and control groups. However, the authors did not control for pre-existing differences, such as child gender and participation in child labor, which may have resulted in pre-existing differences between groups.","",""

The authors conducted a non-experimental study using data originally collected for a randomized controlled trial. They analyzed survey data and state Unemployment Insurance records to estimate the effects of the ERA program on employment entry and retention.
The study found a positive and statistically significant relationship between participation in the ERA program and the likelihood of transitioning into employment and between ERA and employment retention at the Corpus Christi site.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not account for differences in wages or employment between the ERA and comparison groups before the beginning of the ERA program. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Texas ERA program; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The Texas ERA program was offered to people applying for or receiving cash assistance under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program in Texas. Most applicants were not working when they entered the program. The program included pre-employment services such as job-search assistance and a monthly supplement of $200 for participants exiting TANF who worked more than 30 hours per week after receiving an earned income disregard for four months (earned income disregards allow for some income to not be counted against cash aid or other benefits). Participants also received post-employment services such as employer site visits and reemployment assistance provided by local workforce development boards.","In the original evaluation of the ERA program, participants were randomly assigned to the ERA program (treatment group) or to the control group. The treatment and control groups both received pre-employment services focused on quick job entry. However, only the treatment group received the post-employment services or the financial incentive. Although the sample was originally randomized, the authors examined outcomes only for those who entered employment, who were unlikely to be a random subgroup. To address this nonrandom selection, the authors used a non-experimental approach to simultaneously estimate time to employment entry and time to employment exit (that is, retention). The study used data from the Fort Worth and Corpus Christi ERA sites from 2000 to 2002. There were 3,123 participants in the sample at the time of random assignment. The authors restricted the sample to women. Roughly half of the participants had a high school degree and more than 60 percent were between the ages of 18 and 29. More than half the sample had one or more children. More than 60 percent had received previous cash assistance, and about 60 percent had two years or less of previous employment. TANF program staff collected data on participants’ characteristics during program enrollment. The authors obtained employment and quarterly wage data from the Texas Unemployment Insurance system.","At Corpus Christi, for those who were unemployed when the study began, the ERA program increased the likelihood of transitioning into employment by 14.3 percent. For those who were employed when the study began, ERA increased retention (that is, it decreased the likelihood of transitioning out of employment) by 13.1 percent.
At Corpus Christi, when estimating the effects separately during and after the program, the authors found that ERA increased the likelihood of transitioning into employment by 13.6 percent during the program period. It also increased retention by 17.6 percent during the program period.
The study found no statistically significant relationships between ERA and any outcomes at the Fort Worth site.","Although selection into the ERA program was by random assignment, the authors examined a nonrandom subsample of the originally randomly assigned sample and did not account for differences that existed between the treatment and comparison groups before the program began.","",""

Unlike a traditional mentoring program in which mentors are assigned to youth, under YIM, youth nominate their own mentors.
The authors conducted a quantitative analysis using data from the 9-, 21- and 38-month follow-up surveys administered as part of a national evaluation of NGYCP, along with qualitative analysis of interviews with a subsample of NGYCP participants.
The study found that YIM mentors included family friends, extended family members and godparents, school and extracurricular staff, and religious leaders. By the 38-month follow-up survey, 56 percent of youth reported still being in contact with their mentors.
In addition, NGYCP youth who were in contact with their mentors at the 38-month follow-up showed significant benefits on a range of outcomes compared with the control group.","","The NGYCP began in the early 1990s. To be eligible, youth must be 16 to 18 years of age, have dropped out of or been expelled from school, be unemployed, not be drug users, and not be heavily involved in the criminal justice system. The 17-month program consists of a two-week Pre-Challenge phase, a 20-week Residential phase, and a one-year Post-Residential phase. Participants live in barracks-style housing (sometimes on a military base) in a disciplined environment during the first two phases. They wear their hair short, are referred to as cadets, and wear military uniforms. During the Residential phase, they participate in a number of different activities addressing eight core pillars: leadership/followership, responsible citizenship, service to community, life-coping skills, physical fitness, health and hygiene, job skills, and academic excellence. During the Post-Residential phase, after participants are placed in employment, education, or military service, they receive structured mentoring.
The YIM approach operated within the context of the broader NGYCP. Youth nominated one to three potential mentors at the time of application to NGYCP. These matches were finalized during the Residential phase and were expected to continue through at least the year-long Post-Residential phase. Mentors and mentees were expected to meet weekly, with at least two face-to-face meetings per month.
The key distinguishing feature of YIM is that youth selected their own mentors—typically, nonparental adults who were already part of their social networks. Mentors were approved by NGYCP staff and provided with training. Mentoring was voluntary, with no monetary compensation provided.","The study used a mixed-methods explanatory design, harnessing both quantitative and qualitative analysis of data. Goals of the analysis included characterizing the YIM relationships formed, determining whether more-enduring relationships were associated with better outcomes of NGYCP participants, and exploring whether certain characteristics of the matched mentor-mentee pair predicted more-enduring mentoring relationships.
To examine these research questions, the authors used qualitative analysis of follow-up surveys administered as part of a randomized controlled trial evaluation of the NGYCP (see Clearinghouse for Labor Evaluation and Research reviews of the NGYCP studies) . These surveys were administered 9, 21, and 38 months after random assignment. In addition, the authors examined mentors’ data from the data management and reporting system the NGYCP programs used to record data on their participants and mentors. Finally, the authors analyzed qualitative data from interviews conducted with 30 youth who had been contacted for the final follow-up survey.","The study found that mentors selected by youth as part of YIM included family friends, extended family members and godparents, school and extracurricular staff, and religious leaders. More than half (55 percent) of youth reported that they chose the mentors themselves and 37 percent reported being helped by parents. By the 38-month follow-up, 56 percent of youth reported still being in contact with their mentor.
NGYCP youth who were in contact with their mentors at the 38-month follow-up had significantly greater educational and labor market outcomes than youth in the control group.
Qualitative data suggested that enduring mentoring relationships could positively influence youths’ outcomes, both by helping them be successful in the context of the NGYCP through provision of social-emotional support, guidance, and practical assistance to support their general development.","The study presented descriptive information on the nature of the YIM relationships formed and some potential mechanisms by which they could influence youths’ educational and labor market outcomes. These findings did not, however, represent a causal impact of YIM on youth outcomes because the duration of the relationship was determined by the mentee and mentor; more research would be needed to establish that the duration of YIM relationships had an impact on youths’ outcomes. The authors took care to not overstate the nature of the findings.
In addition, the study examined YIM within the context of the NGYCP. It is unclear whether these results would translate to YIM implemented in a different context.","",""

Using survey data from a randomized controlled trial, the authors analyzed the impact of the CWCLP program on schooling and work after approximately 12-16 months of implementation (the timing of implementation varied).
When compared to control group children, the study showed that CWCLP participating children spent significantly less time in economic activities and significantly more time in school-related activities. Participating children also had significantly higher school enrollment and significantly higher school attendance than children in the control group.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because, although it was based on a randomized controlled trial with high attrition, the authors demonstrated that the treatment and control groups were similar before the intervention. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the CWCLP program, but other factors might also have contributed.","This study was conducted by staff from ICF, which administers CLEAR. Therefore, the review of this study was conducted by an independent consultant trained in applying the CLEAR causal evidence guidelines. Absence of conflict of interest.","The Combating Worst Forms of Child Labor by Reinforcing Policy Response and Promoting Sustainable Livelihoods and Educational Opportunities in Egypt (CWCLP) project was funded by the US Department of Labor and implemented by the World Food Programme, the International Labor Organization, and the United Nations Children’s Fund from 2011 to 2015. The project included a variety of activities intended to reduce child labor, including advocating policy reform and providing education, nutrition, and livelihood support. Children in treatment villages were offered the opportunity to enroll in a community school and received monthly take home rations worth approximately $11 USD, contingent on school attendance. Some mothers of participants received income generating activity support.","The study took place in small, rural villages in five governorates in Egypt (Assuit, Menya, Sohag, Fayoum, and Sharqiyah). The study randomly assigned 79 villages to the treatment group and 36 communities to the control group. Within each village, eligible children were identified and data were collected about the children and their families. To be eligible, the child had to be between ages 6 and 11 and either working or at risk of working and not enrolled in school. The sample included 983 children in the treatment group and 440 children in the control group. Baseline survey data were collected in October and November, 2011. Endline data were collected in March and April, 2013. To test the impact of the CWCLP program on schooling and work, the authors compared the treatment and control groups using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.","Employment/Child labor 
When compared to control group children, the study showed that CWCLP participating children had spent significantly less time in economic activities. In particular, the intervention resulted in an approximate three-hour reduction in time spent on economic activities per week.
Education (School participation/enrollment)
When compared to control group children, the study showed that CWCLP participating children had significantly higher school enrollment, attendance, and time spent on school-related activities. At the time of the endline survey, 71 percent of participating children were attending school compared to 24 percent of children in the control group.","Baseline data were collected during a more active agricultural season than were endline data. Since the impact assessment is based on comparison of treatment and control groups rather than a direct comparison of baseline and endline, the difference in data collection periods does not affect the impact assessment. The authors note that it might limit our knowledge of the effect of the intervention on the most active period of agricultural activity. Additionally, the timing of implementation of the intervention varied. It was significantly delayed in some areas, so not all areas received the same exposure to the intervention. The study was not able to interview all of the original participants during the endline survey. To address the potential bias caused by study attrition, the authors developed raking weights, which were used for all of the endline analyses.","",""

Specifically, the authors compared the impact of Internet job searches on unemployment duration using survey data from 2005–2008 to the estimated impact from a prior study on Internet job searches that used 1998–2001 survey data.
The study used a nonexperimental design to compare the impacts of Internet job searches on the duration of unemployment at two different time periods. For the first time period, the authors analyzed data from the United States Current Population Survey (CPS) from 1998 to 2001. For the second time period, the authors used data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) 1997 sample, covering 2005 to 2008.
The study found that in the earlier period (1998–2001) unemployed adults who used the Internet for any job search activities were unemployed 22 percent longer than those who did not use the Internet, whereas in the later period (2005–2008) young adults who used the Internet for job search activities were reemployed 25 percent faster than comparable workers who did not use the Internet as part of their job search strategy. Thus, the study found that the effect of using the Internet as part of a job search strategy on unemployment durations reversed in the 10 years covered by the two studies.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not account for other factors that might have affected unemployment duration. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the use of Internet search activities; other factors might have contributed.","","","Research suggests a large increase in the use of the Internet for job search activities in the past 20 years. In this study, the definition of Internet job search was driven by the data available from the NLSY Wave 12 survey, which asked respondents about their use of the Internet to conduct job search activities. The study included two separate analyses. In the replication study, the authors reproduced the analysis from a previous study using data from the CPS Computer and Internet Use Supplements from December 1998 to August 2000, as well as monthly CPS surveys through August 2001. The study estimated the impacts of Internet use on unemployment duration using the full sample of 4,139 unemployed adults, as well as smaller sample of 669 unemployed young adults ages 23 to 29.
In the updated novel study, the authors conducted new analyses using data collected from the NLSY 1997 sample. They administered one survey during autumn 2008 and covered the years 2005 to 2008. The sample included 840 respondents who were 24 to 28 years old at the time of data collection; were employed at the time of the survey; had started that job at any time since January 1, 2007; had experienced a period of joblessness before starting that job; and reported conducting some job search activities during that period.
In both study periods, the authors compared the duration of unemployment between survey respondents who used the Internet for job search or related activities and those who did not. The authors then compared the results from the replication and novel studies to see if the effect of Internet job search activities on unemployment duration had changed during the 10 years covered by the two periods.","Overall, the study found that the effect of Internet job searches on unemployment durations reversed in the 10 years covered by the two studies. In the earlier period, from 1998 to 2000, the study found that unemployed adults who used the Internet for job search activities were unemployed 22 percent longer than those who did not use the Internet as a job search tool. In contrast, the study found that young adults ages 24 to 28 who were unemployed at some time from 2005 to 2007 were reemployed 25 percent faster than comparable workers who did not use the Internet as part of their job search strategy.","Although the study accounted for several factors that might affect unemployment, including the age, race, gender, and education of the survey respondents, it did not account for differences in prior employment status or earnings.
The outcomes were not measured in the same way across the two studies. In the novel analysis, the survey was administered after the period of unemployment had ended; therefore, the self-reported duration depended on the recall of the survey respondent. In the replication study, data on job search activities were collected during the period of unemployment, and follow-up surveys determined the unemployment duration.
In addition, the study compared results from two different demographic groups. In the novel analysis, the sample comprised young adults ages 24 to 28 who had been unemployed for some period of time immediately preceding their current job. In the replication study, the sample comprised adults of any age who were unemployed at the time of the survey.","",""

The study found that the treatment group earned significantly less than the comparison group in the three years after WIA registration. Individuals in the treatment group earned an average of $5,567 and $5,227 less than those in the comparison group in State A and State B, respectively.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it was based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design; this is the highest causal evidence rating possible for a nonexperimental design. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the training services received, but other factors might also have contributed","","The WIA dislocated worker program training services involved classes in occupational skills and on-the-job training provided by private firms. Selection into the training services could have occurred in a variety of ways, including referral from a training provider or program staff member, individual choice, or natural progression through prior services offered by WIA. There were no specific eligibility criteria for registering in the WIA program itself.","The study implemented a nonexperimental analysis of the employment and earnings of WIA dislocated worker program participants in two states. State A, a medium sized state located on the East Coast, had 10,836 WIA dislocated worker program participants of whom 4,347 received the training services.

In State B, the treatment group earned less in quarters 1 through 7, compared to the comparison group. However, in quarters 10 through 12 the treatment group earned more, on average, than those in the comparison group.
In State B, the treatment group was less likely to be employed than the comparison group in quarters 1 through 7, but was more likely to be employed in quarters 11 and 12.","The program was designed such that WIA participants would receive core and intensive services, followed by training if they were still not employed. However, in practice, some participants received training without receiving core or intensive services. Thus, the treatment in this study can be understood as training plus the opportunity to receive core and intensive services, whereas the comparison condition is the opportunity to receive core and intensive services only.
The authors made a large number of comparisons in the earnings and employment domains without adjusting for these multiple comparisons.

The authors used administrative data from the CUNY Office of Institutional Research and Assessment to match students who participated in ASAP with similar students who enrolled the previous year and did not participate in ASAP and compared their outcomes.
The study found that ASAP students had higher one-year retention rates, were more likely to graduate within two or three years, and accrued more credits than comparison students.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the analysis compared students in different cohorts, and we cannot rule out the possibility that differences in outcomes between the two groups were due to other changes taking place at the same time that only affected one of the cohorts.

The program aimed to support community college students seeking associate’s degrees by providing enhanced services. The program was implemented in all six CUNY community colleges and included the following components: (1) a requirement to attend college full time; (2) block-scheduled classes with other ASAP students for the first year of the program; (3) participation in an ASAP seminar that covers goal-setting, study skills, and academic planning for at least two semesters of the program; (4) free use of textbooks during the semester; (5) comprehensive advising from an ASAP adviser with a small caseload of 60 to 80 students; (6) tutoring; (7) career services; (8) a tuition waiver that covered any gap between a student’s financial aid and tuition and fees; and (9) free monthly MetroCards. ASAP encouraged participants to complete their developmental education early and graduate within three years. Therefore, ASAP included only students in approved majors. Approved majors were linked to New York’s economic needs and transfer opportunities within the CUNY system and had requirements that could reasonably be completed in three years.","Students in the study’s treatment group were New York City residents, had fewer than 12 college credits, were pursuing an associate’s degree in one of the approved majors for ASAP, were not enrolled in any other special CUNY support program, and had completed developmental education coursework. The authors used propensity-score matching procedures to select comparison group students who entered CUNY in 2006 and were similar to treatment students who entered in 2007. They estimated impacts by comparing outcomes of ASAP students to those of the matched comparison students. The authors matched ASAP and comparison students using the following variables: gender, race and ethnicity, age, college attended, exemption from taking CUNY assessment tests, continuing or transfer student status, dependency status for financial aid purposes, and Pell and New York State’s Tuition Assistance Program grant receipt as a proxy for income. Analyses used student-level data and followed students from initial enrollment into CUNY or ASAP through three academic years.","The study found that the one-year retention rate for ASAP students was 11.9 percent higher than that of the matched sample of comparison students, a statistically significant difference.
After three semesters, ASAP students had earned an average of 3.7 more credits than the matched comparison students. They also accumulated significantly more credits (an average of 6.6 more) than matched comparison students after three years of college enrollment. Both differences were statistically significant.
Two and three years after enrollment, 30.2 and 54.7 percent of ASAP students earned a degree, compared with 12.1 and 26.4 percent of matched comparison students, respectively. Both were statistically significant differences.","The treatment group and the comparison group were from different cohorts—the treatment group entered CUNY in 2007, and the comparison group entered CUNY in 2006. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that differences in outcomes between the treatment and comparison groups were due to other changes taking place at the same time that only affected one of the study groups. For example, suppose a policy change that was enacted in 2007 decreased income thresholds for financial aid. This change could have made it easier for ASAP students to remain at CUNY and/or earn more credits. In this case, any observed differences in outcomes between ASAP and comparison students could be due to the policy change rather than ASAP.","",""

The authors argued that women and racial minorities perform worse in certain fields, such as STEM, when they feel threatened by stereotypes implying that their gender or race makes them inferior to their male or white peers. For this study, the authors primed treatment students to think about their gender, race, and ethnicity before completing a survey to measure self-efficacy in science. This priming was intended to make feelings of stereotype threat more acute.
The study randomly assigned students majoring in a STEM field to either the treatment group, which received stereotype threat priming before taking the survey, or the control group, which took the same survey but did not receive stereotype threat priming. The authors collected data from an author-generated online survey on feelings of self-efficacy and from academic records for course grades.
The study found that the stereotype threat priming had no significant effects by gender when comparing outcomes for the treatment and control groups.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because this is a randomized controlled trial with unknown attrition, and the authors did not control for background characteristics likely to affect the outcomes of interest. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects would have been attributable to stereotype threat priming; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","","The study took place at two universities in the United States, one in the southeast region and one in the southwest region. At each university, the authors selected a random sample of students pursuing traditional degrees in STEM, stratified by race, to participate in an online survey that measured feelings of self-efficacy toward work in scientific or technical fields and toward coping with issues that might arise with completing a college degree. The survey also measured the level of discrepancy between respondents’ expectations for themselves and their self-reported ability to match their expectations. A total of 294 students were included in the study.
For students in the treatment group, the intervention constituted a series of prompts to enter their gender, race, and ethnicity in large, bolded font before completing a survey. The authors suggested these questions create stereotype threat priming for the treatment group students because the students would begin the survey thinking more about their gender and race, which could trigger the internalized stereotypes about women and racial minorities’ typical performance in STEM fields. Students in the control group were asked the same questions about their gender, race, and ethnicity after completing all other survey questions, and these questions appeared in the same font as all other questions in the survey. Therefore, the authors posited that the control group did not face any priming regarding their gender or race before taking the survey, which might limit the effect of stereotype threat.
The authors collected data from both the survey itself and institutional records, which provided information on course grades and high school grade point averages (GPAs). The authors estimated regression models comparing the outcomes of treatment and control group members, and assessed whether the findings varied by gender, race, and self-reported discrepancy between one’s expectations and ability to meet those expectations. The authors separated findings on postsecondary GPA into fields in which women are typically underrepresented (physics, engineering, computer sciences, and math) and fields in which women are typically overrepresented or proportionally represented as compared to men (life sciences and social sciences).","The study found that the stereotype threat priming, as implemented in the survey, had no significant effects by gender when comparing outcomes for the treatment and control groups.","The authors dropped five cases with outlier data on the self-efficacy score outcome, and indicated that there was also considerable missing data for GPA outcomes. The authors stated that they used auxiliary variables to address missing data concerns, but the study does not provide enough information to clarify the exact empirical strategy used nor to assess attrition.
In addition, it is unclear from the study when the authors conducted the survey in relation to the semester from which grade outcomes were measured. If the survey took place during or after the semester, then the findings from this study may not be considered causal.","",""

The authors used census data from a randomized sample of municipalities to compare the outcomes of children who received the conditional cash transfer to those who did not. The authors used statistical models to estimate program effects.
The study found a significant relationship between the PRAF-II and child labor, with work outside the home decreasing by 3 percentage points. Program participation was also significantly related to an 8-percentage point increase in school enrollment.

This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Programa de Asignación Familiar; other factors are likely to have contributed.","Absence of conflict of interest.","The Honduran Programa de Asignación Familiar (PRAF), or Family Allowance Program, was a conditional cash transfer program that began in the early 1990s. The second phase of the program, PRAF-II, began in the late 1990s with support from the Inter-American Development Bank. PRAF-II provided two types of cash transfers to households. The education transfer of $50 USD per year was paid for children aged 6-12 who enrolled and regularly attended grades 1-4. The health transfer of $40 USD per year was paid for children under 3 or a pregnant mother if they regularly visited a health center. Households could receive up to three education transfers and two health transfers per year.
In addition to conditional cash transfers paid to households, PRAF-II planned to invest in schools and health centers in the municipalities. Parent associations in primary schools were to receive approximately $4,000 USD per year (dependent on school size) conditional on obtaining legal status and preparing a quality improvement plan. Local health centers were to receive $6,000 USD per year (dependent on their client base) conditional on forming a health team and preparing a budget and proposal. At the end of 2002, however, only 7 percent of the education and 17 percent of the health funds were distributed to municipalities.","The study used groups based on a randomized controlled trial (Glewwe & Olinto, 2004). The 298 municipalities in Honduras were rank ordered, from lowest to highest, based on the average height-for-age z-scores (HAZ scores) of first graders in the country. The HAZ score served as a proxy for poverty. Of the 298 municipalities, 70 were included in the study. The 70 municipalities were stratified based on the HAZ scores (14 municipalities in five quintiles) and randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups or a control group. Group 1 municipalities received the household cash transfers. Group 2 municipalities received the household cash transfers and the school and health center funds. Group 3 municipalities only received the school and health center funds. Group 4, the control group, received no funds. Since the municipality school and health center funds were not distributed as planned, the authors combined groups 1 and 2 (the household cash transfer treatment group – 40 municipalities) and groups 3 and 4 (the control group – 30 municipalities).
The authors used census data that was collected from all 298 municipalities after the program was implemented. The authors merged individual and household data with municipal-level data. Data were analyzed for 120,411 children across the treatment and control groups using regression models. The sample consisted of children 6 to 12 years of age who had not yet completed fourth grade. Child labor was measured by asking if the child (ages 7 and older) worked outside the home the week before the census data were collected. School enrollment was defined as being enrolled in school at the time of the census.","Employment/Child labor
The study found a significant relationship between the PRAF-II and child labor, with work outside the home decreasing by 3 percentage points for children participating in the program.

The authors compared child labor and school enrollment outcomes, using a follow-up survey administered over a year after the program began.

This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Bono de Desarrollo Humano program, and not to other factors.","Absence of conflict of interest.","The BDH was an unconditional cash transfer program that was implemented in four provinces in Ecuador. The program, run by the government of Ecuador, was designed to replace an earlier cash transfer program by limiting eligibility to higher poverty households. In BDH, households were eligible for the intervention if they were in the lowest two-fifths of income and had a child 6-17 years old. Once selected into the program, program participants could receive the equivalent of a $15 (USD) monthly cash transfer without having to meet any conditions. To receive the money, they needed to either visit a bank or arrange to receive the money in their bank account.","The study used a randomized controlled trial to test the impact of the BDH program. From the four provinces, the authors selected a random sample of parishes. In each of these parishes, 1,488 eligible households were randomly selected for the study. To be eligible, participants needed to be in the bottom two-fifths of income and have a child 6-17 years old. These households were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group via a lottery. The treatment group households were to receive the $15 monthly cash transfer, and the control group was not to receive any benefits. However, there was noncompliance with the study. Cash transfers were not distributed to all the treatment households and some control group households received the transfer. As a result, the study authors used an intent-to-treat approach to analyze differences between the groups, maintaining the integrity of random assignment.
Households completed a baseline survey before transfers began and then completed a follow-up survey more than a year later. Both surveys asked about household demographic characteristics along with schooling and child labor outcomes of interest. In the baseline survey, there were 993 children ages 11-16 in the treatment group and 890 in the control group. Using data from the follow-up survey, the authors compared child labor and school enrollment outcomes between the treatment and control groups and controlled for baseline differences such as child age, gender, and mother’s education. While the analysis did not control for other household socioeconomic characteristics, households in both groups were expected to be in the bottom two-fifths of income given the program’s eligibility criteria.","Employment/Child labor
Children assigned to the treatment group had a significantly lower rate of participating in child labor at all than those assigned to the control group.
Education (School participation/enrollment)
Children assigned to the treatment group had a significantly higher likelihood of school enrollment compared to those assigned to the control group.","While the study was a randomized controlled trial, the authors reported problems with noncompliance. Many of the households in the treatment group did not receive cash transfers in accordance with their assigned group (31% of children in households in the treatment group did not receive the transfer and 38% of children in households in the control group received it). This means that the findings only show the overall effect of being assigned to receive the transfer, but does not show the effect of actually receiving the transfers. If there was greater compliance with the experiment, it is possible that the treatment effect would be different.","",""

The available services included employment and case management services, job search assistance and allowances, training, relocation allowances, and some cash income supports. Eligible employees must have lost their jobs or have been notified of unemployment risk due to import competition or shifts in foreign production.","The authors identified TAA participants and selected a random sample of those who had been laid off from a TAA-certified firm from November 1, 2005, to October 31, 2006.

In total, the study included 2,054 TAA participants and 1,796 matched workers who lost their jobs but were not eligible for and did not participate in TAA.
The study estimated the impact of TAA by using a regression analysis to compare the outcomes of TAA participants and nonparticipants. The survey sample was slightly more than half female, nearly two-thirds were non-Hispanic white, about 75 percent had less than a high school education, and the average age was 49 years. The study measured outcomes using data collected in two telephone surveys and from administrative records.","Education and training completion and attainment. The study found that the percentage of TAA participants who completed an education or training program was 31 percentage points higher and the percentage who earned a certificate or degree significantly was 30 percentage points higher than the percentages among nonparticipants. The percentage of workers who obtained a Generalized Education Degree was 17 percentage points higher for TAA participants than nonparticipants.
Employment. The percentage of TAA participants who became employed during the four years after their UI claim was significantly lower than nonparticipants. The difference between participants and nonparticipants was more than 25 percentage points in the first two years after UI benefits began, but declined over time and fell below a 10 percentage point difference in the fourth year.
Earnings. The study found that the average annual earnings of TAA participants were significantly lower in all four years after the UI claim than those of nonparticipants. In the first year, TAA participants earned an average of $12,674 less than nonparticipants. This difference decreased after the second year and, in the fourth year, TAA participants earned $3,273 less than nonparticipants.
Public benefits receipt. TAA participants received significantly more in UI benefits through the first six quarters of follow-up than nonparticipants. In addition, the percentage of TAA participants receiving food stamp benefits was 2.9 percentage points higher, and the average food stamp benefit amount was $201 more than nonparticipants during the follow-up period.","The study analyzed samples of new UI recipients.

Some might ultimately have participated in TAA because they could not find new jobs quickly, and it is possible that the job search activities of those who knew about TAA were affected by anticipation of being eligible for TAA services.

The study’s objective was to examine whether increases in the number of funds offered in a retirement plan caused investors to allocate their contributions more evenly across all available investment options.
The authors administered one survey to a nationally representative sample of U.S. households and two surveys to people from consumer panels. The surveys contained information on hypothetical savings plans that were manipulated to include either a small or large fund assortment size. Participants were instructed to choose the plans in which they would invest and indicate the percentage they would invest in each of the chosen funds.
The study found that participants were more likely to allocate hypothetical investments across all available funds when offered a small versus large assortment size.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this portion of the study is moderate because, although the authors controlled for observable characteristics of samples members and there was no evidence that survey versions were systematically assigned to sample members, the Clearinghouse for Labor Evaluation and Research (CLEAR) could not confirm that survey versions were randomly assigned.
Analysis of employees’ data 
The study’s objective was to determine whether the number of fund options offered by a 401(k) plan influenced the investment behavior of plan members.
The authors compared investment behaviors among employees offered 10 or 19 fund options for investment, controlling for employees’ characteristics. The analysis used administrative data on contributions to the defined contribution plan of the Oregon University System. The study used an interrupted time series (ITS) design that analyzed changes in outcomes before and after an increase in the number of available investment options.
The analysis demonstrated that offering a larger fund assortment size was associated with a statistically insignificant decrease in the tendency of employees to invest in all available funds and spread invested dollars evenly among chosen alternatives.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is low. This means that we are not confident that the estimated effects are solely attributable to fund assortment size; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","","","Experiments using U.S. households
Participants were significantly more likely to invest in all available funds when offered a small fund assortment size compared with a large assortment size.
Increases in fund assortment size were associated with significant increases in the propensity to allocate investments evenly across chosen funds only when participants faced a high cognitive load.
Analysis of employees’ data
Participants offered 19 funds invested in a significantly larger number of funds than those offered 10 options (5.30 compared with 3.74 funds, on average). However, increasing the number of available funds for investment did not significantly change the probability that participants would invest in all available funds or that the allocation of money would be evenly spread across funds.","In the studies using survey data, the authors used ordinary least squares regression and controlled adequately for observable characteristics that might be associated with the outcomes of interest, such as age, gender, income, and 401(k) enrollment. There is no reason to believe that the treatment and comparison groups differed systematically; however, CLEAR could not determine how participants were allocated to different versions of the survey. Thus, these studies cannot be considered randomized controlled trials.
Low response rates in study 1a also suggest that survey respondents might differ somewhat from the population as a whole. Additionally, participants in studies 1b and 2 were members of consumer panels, which might not represent the entire population and could lead to less generalizable results. It should also be noted that the studies of survey data asked participants to make hypothetical decisions; these decisions might not represent actual behavior.
In the final study, the comparison and treatment groups fall along a chronological continuum; thus, effects are estimated in an interrupted time series framework. The authors conducted only a single demonstration of the intervention and did not provide any evidence to suggest that its timing was not confounded with prior trends, so it is possible that the intervention coincided with other events that mask its true effect.","",""

Advancement services included career coaching, skill development, and education to stabilize participants’ employment and help them find better-paying jobs.

The author compared mean outcomes for students enrolled in the learning community (the treatment group) and students enrolled in the same nonlearning community developmental math course in previous semesters (the comparison group). The study used administrative data to measure retention in the developmental math course and persistence into the next semester.
The study found no statistically significant differences in outcomes between the treatment and comparison groups.

Learning communities can consist of paired or linked courses; the main characteristic is the intentional formation of a scholarly community of students and instructors. In this study, the learning community consisted of two linked courses: MAT 055, a developmental math course, and GEN 102, a student success course. The goal of the learning community in this study was to provide peer-to-peer and institutional support for underprepared students.","The author compared retention in the developmental math course and persistence in college enrollment into the next semester of students enrolled in the learning community (MAT 055/GEN 102) with students enrolled in the nonlearning community version of MAT 055 at Gateway Community and Technical College.

These students scored from 26 to 35 in the pre-algebra domain of the Computer-Adapted Placement Assessment and Support Services (COMPASS) math placement test, and self-selected into the learning community. The comparison group consisted of 52 students who scored in the same range as the treatment group on the COMPASS math placement test but were enrolled in nonlearning community sections of MAT 055 taught in previous semesters. The author compared the mean retention and persistence of the two groups using administrative data from the college.","The study found no statistically significant differences in retention or persistence between students in the learning community and students in the comparison group.","The authors did not include controls for student characteristics in their analysis of retention and persistence, so estimated impacts could reflect pre-existing differences between the groups being compared, and not program impacts.

The program sought to help youth with disabilities ages 16 through 22 who received Supplemental Security Income and resided in Miami-Dade County maximize their self-sufficiency.
The study examined implementation of BHBF, focusing on major aspects of service delivery, including the background, local context and service environment. It also provided information on participants’ characteristics and satisfaction with the program. The authors conducted qualitative analysis of staff and participant interviews, including data collected from site visits; and descriptive quantitative analysis of participants’ baseline and follow-up survey data and service utilization data from a management information system.
The study found that participants began receiving services soon after enrollment. Some services were more challenging to implement than others, but all participants received some project services and most received at least one of the four major types of service: benefits planning, employment, education, and case management. 
Study findings related to implementation challenges and solutions are potentially applicable to other current or future projects that provide employment-related services to youth with disabilities.","","BHBF in Miami-Dade County, Florida, was one of six project sites using a randomized design as part of the larger YTD, sponsored by the Social Security Administration (SSA), which intended to help youth with disabilities become more economically self-sufficient and improve their employment outcomes. Each site varied in terms of services provided and targeted participants. From April 2008 to March 2012, ServiceSource, a nonprofit organization focused on people with disabilities, offered person-centered case management services to young SSA beneficiaries (ages 16 to 22) with severe disabilities. BHBF included personalized employment services and benefits counseling, financial literacy training, access to individual development accounts, and case management services focused on reducing barriers to employment.
All YTD participants were also eligible for waivers that (1) extended the student earned income exclusion to all YTD participants regardless of age, (2) increased the earned income exclusion to a $1 reduction in Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit for every $4 earned above a base amount, and (3) delayed benefit cessation for YTD participants who were determined ineligible for benefits after a benefit review or age-18 SSI medical redetermination.","The implementation portion of the study sought to describe whether the demonstration, as implemented by BHBF, tested the service intervention as conceived by SSA. In doing so, the study described the major aspects of implementation, including the local context; inputs, resources, and partnerships; service delivery, including dosage; and participants’ characteristics and satisfaction with program services. The study drew on program documents; site visits (including interviews with managers, staff, and partner staff, and focus groups with participants); telephone interviews with project management; service provision data from the program’s management information system; and baseline and 12-month follow-up surveys of participants. The study included two BHBF locations, one in the northern part of the county and the other in the southern part, from September 2008 through May 2011.","The study found that BHBF implemented the YTD model as designed, and participants began receiving services soon after enrollment. Some services were more challenging to implement than others. For example, only two participants opened individual development accounts, which were like savings accounts, and some participants might not have received the education services they desired. BHBF modified the services provided over time, increasing its attention to paid job placement starting in May 2009 due to low rates of paid job placement up until that point. Some participants also faced transportation and child care barriers, which program staff partly addressed by providing limited public transit passes and linking some working participants to subsidized child care.
The program operated in a challenging context, but compensated for some of these challenges by employing a strong program manager who leveraged dedicated program staff. Miami-Dade County constituted an economically depressed environment, and although services already existed for youth with disabilities, these services were often fragmented and uncoordinated, and many agencies had waiting lists for youth to be served. To implement BHBF, the grantee was able to establish formal partnerships with several organizations to create project-specific materials and resources, and provide staff training and referrals to social services. The study found low staff turnover and high staff commitment to the project. The project manager also demonstrated strong relationships with staff, but would terminate underperforming staff, such as those who could not successfully recruit employer partners for the program.
All participants received some project services and most received at least one of the four major types of service: benefits planning, employment, education, and case management. Of these, 99 percent received benefits planning and at least one employment service, and 96 percent received case management. Overall, 84 percent received an education service and 34 percent received employment training. BHBF staff made 47 service contacts for each participant, for a total of 29 hours of service, and an average of 18 hours of direct service contacts involving youth. In the follow-up survey, nearly half of respondents did not recall receiving BHBF services; possible reasons for this included a discrepancy between how respondents and the survey itself referred to BHBF. Of the respondents who remembered the program, most rated it as good and useful, saying that it provided information about employment opportunities and helped them work effectively with others.","The study clearly identified the research question and topics of interest and explored an array of data sources to explore these topics. It included a systematic description of findings and effectively illustrated findings with case studies, quotes from interviews and focus groups, and descriptive quantitative management information system and survey data. Qualitative and quantitative data were triangulated, but the study did not include a thorough description of data collection, data analysis, and data quality control. The study findings are potentially applicable to other current or future projects that provide employment-related services to youth with disabilities; however, the absence of information on methods and analysis makes it difficult to determine the extent to which the findings reflect the average program experience.","",""

The author used a nonexperimental design to examine establishments’ employment share of race, ethnicity, and gender groups in seven occupational categories over time using data from annual EEO-1 Employer Information Report files.
The study found that, among firms that became federal contractors from 1973 to 2003, the share of Hispanic women, white women, African American women, and African American men significantly increased in some skilled occupational categories compared with firms that did not become federal contractors in that period. The study also found that the share of African American men and women increased significantly in manual jobs at federal contractor firms, compared with nonfederal contractor firms in that period.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it was based on a strong non-experimental design. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to affirmative action requirements for federal contractors, but other factors might also have contributed.","","In 1961, President Kennedy signed Executive Order 19025, which prohibited discrimination by race, creed, color, and national origin among federal contractors and required that employers take “affirmative action” to ensure fair hiring and advancement. Affirmative action Executive Order 11246, signed by President Johnson in 1965, reinforced prohibitions in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and earlier executive orders against discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin; subsequent Orders and revisions have added sex (1967) and sexual orientation and gender identity (2014) as protected classes. Order 11246 required the federal government and federal contractors with 50 or more employees or $50,000 in contracts to develop written affirmative action plans and ensure equal opportunities for all workers. The Order authorized the Secretary of Labor to establish the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs to enforce federal contractors’ compliance.
The number of employer discrimination lawsuits and class action lawsuits declined in the 1980s. In the 1990s, there was renewed focus on affirmative action policies following the Civil Rights Act of 1991 that allowed plaintiffs the option of a trial by jury to recover damages and established the Federal Glass Ceiling Commission to prepare recommendations on the advancement of protected groups. In addition, the administration of President Clinton accelerated enforcement of affirmative action and nondiscrimination laws, leading to a rising number of debarments for contractors because of noncompliance. In subsequent years, many states rescinded affirmative action policies.","The study used a nonexperimental design. The author estimated regression models comparing the employment shares of six specific race-by-gender demographic groups in seven occupational categories over time among firms that were and were not federal contractors. The decision to become a federal contractor required compliance with affirmative action requirements. The models controlled for fixed firm effects and time-varying firm characteristics as well as industry and regional effects each year. The occupational categories studied were based on those reported in the EEO-1 data: managers and officers, professionals, technicians, sales, office and clerical, manual, and services. The study used establishment-level data from 1973 to 2003 from the EEO-1 Employer Information Report files. These reports are annual establishment surveys of workforce data that employers meeting certain size requirements must submit to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. More than 100,000 firms submitted these reports in 1973 and each year from 1978 to 2003.","The study found that firms that became federal contractors during the period from 1973 to 2003 had a significant increase relative to noncontractors in the share of professional jobs held by white females as well as a significant increase in the share of clerical jobs and manual jobs held by African American females.
For African American men, the study found a significant increase in the share of technician jobs and manual jobs in federal contractor firms relative to noncontractors.
The study found a significant increase in the share of Hispanic females in technician jobs in federal contractor firms relative to noncontractors, whereas the Hispanic males’ share of managerial and manual jobs decreased significantly.
The study found that in federal contractor firms during the 1973 to 2003 period, there was a significant decrease relative to noncontractors in white males’ share of professional and clerical jobs.","The author estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to employment. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The author did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","",""

The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted at the Tuscaloosa Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center. Treatment group members received IPS services, whereas the control group received standard Vocational Rehabilitation Program (VRP) services. Data sources included patients’ records from the clinical research coordinator and daily logs completed by participants.
The study found that IPS had positive impacts on competitive employment and gross income.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it is based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to IPS, and not other factors.","","IPS was a type of supported employment intervention that aimed to improve occupational and rehabilitation outcomes for people with severe and persistent mental illness. IPS participants received rapid job search and individualized job placement services from IPS specialists, who provided IPS services exclusively and carried out all phases of vocational services. IPS participants made their job choices based on their preferences and strengths. All IPS clients were encouraged to participate in services with no exclusion criteria. IPS specialists continually helped clients find other jobs when one job ended, spent 70 percent or more of their time in the community supporting participants, and were available for virtually unlimited support and follow-up. IPS specialists maintained a caseload of 25 or fewer clients and were integrated with each client’s clinical medical treatment team.
VRP services, which were the standard care provided at the Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center, were typically less intensive and less specific to the individual. For example, the choice of employment was less related to the preferences and strengths of the client, but instead was driven more by general labor market conditions, such as available short-term transitional work experiences. In contrast to IPS specialists, VRP specialists provided some services in the community, provided limited follow-up and support, and did not have strict caseload size limits. They were not integrated with clients’ clinical medical teams.","This study used a randomized controlled trail to examine the impact of IPS on veterans’ competitive employment, earnings, and income. To be eligible for the study, veterans at the Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center had to have a PTSD diagnosis, be age 19 to 60, have a medical clearance for work activity, be unemployed but interested in competitive employment, and plan to remain within a 100-mile radius of Tuscaloosa for the 12-month study duration. Eligible veteran volunteers were enrolled in the study from 2006 to 2010 and were randomly assigned into the treatment group, which was eligible to receive IPS services, or the control group, which could receive standard VRP services. There were 85 randomly assigned participants: 42 were assigned to IPS and 43 to VRP. In addition to a diagnosis of PTSD, 89 percent of study participants had major depressive disorder, 42 percent had alcohol dependence, 21 percent abused alcohol, 37 percent were drug dependent, and 18 percent abused drugs.
The authors’ impacts evaluation method varied across outcomes. The authors used a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with a log-rank test to measure whether IPS affected time until the first week worked in a competitive job. For the other outcomes, including the number of weeks, days, and hours worked in a competitive job and gross wages, they performed t-tests to measure program impacts.","The study found that IPS participants achieved competitive employment more quickly than did VRP participants. This difference in employment times, which was not quantified, was statistically significant.
The IPS group was competitively employed 21.6 weeks on average during the 52-week intervention period compared with 6.8 weeks on average for the VRP group. This difference was statistically significant.
On average, total gross 12-month income from competitive sources was $9,264 for IPS and $2,601 for VRP, with a statistically significant difference of $6,663. The difference in favor of the IPS group extended to total gross 12-month income from all sources—$9,308 for IPS relative to $3,909 for VRP.","To be eligible for the study, veterans had to have expressed interest in competitive employment. Therefore, the results might not extend to people with PTSD who had not expressed an interest in competitive employment.","",""

The study used household survey data from a randomized controlled trial. Due to pre-existing baseline differences between the original treatment and control groups, the authors used a matched comparison group design to compare child schooling and labor outcomes between children in the treatment group and those in the control group.
The study found that the SCTS program significantly decreased the proportion of children in paid domestic work outside of the household and the proportion of children pulled from school to work for food or money.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because there was compromised randomization but the authors ensured that the groups being compared were similar before the intervention. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Malawi Social Cash Transfer Scheme (SCTS); however, other factors might have also contributed.","Absence of conflict of interest.","The Malawi Social Cash Transfer Scheme (SCTS) was designed to alleviate poverty through the distribution of cash transfers. The program was implemented in the Mchinji District in Malawi, in eight local areas called Village Development Groups (VDGs). Households in the bottom 10 percent of incomes were given a cash transfer, although the specific selection process and inclusion criteria varied by VDG. While the authors consider the program to be an “unconditional cash transfer program,” households can receive a larger transfer based on school participation. In the program, the treatment group received $4-13 (USD) per month based on the number of household members, plus $1.30 (USD) for each child attending primary school and $2.60 (USD) for each child attending secondary school.","The study used household survey data from a randomized controlled trial (Miller, Tsoka, & Reichert, 2008). Eight VDGs were randomly assigned to either the treatment (n=4) or control group (n=4). Each VDG selected households for participation in the study. A survey was administered before program initiation, and then 6 and 12 months later. The control group did not receive any benefits until after the one-year follow-up survey was administered. At that point, they could receive the same benefits as the treatment group.
In the original study, that there were differences between the treatment and control groups at baseline, possibly due to the different selection process of households in each VDG. To mitigate these differences, the current study used the original treatment and control groups to construct a matched comparison group. The propensity score matching approach matched on several individual child and household characteristics (i.e., child age, child gender, head of household education level). After matching, there were 365 treatment households (1,090 children) and 386 control households (786 children) after removing those who did not complete the study surveys. The authors conducted a difference-in-differences analyses where they looked at the size of the change for the treatment group, controlling for change in the matched-comparison group. The difference-in-differences approach controlled for baseline differences on child outcomes including school attendance and child labor.","Employment/Child labor
After a year of the intervention, the study found that there was a significantly smaller proportion of children in the treatment group that participated in paid domestic work outside of the household than in the control group.
However, there was not a significant difference between the treatment and control groups in the proportion of children that participated in non-household income work or in the hours spent on non-household income work.
Education (School participation/enrollment)
A year after the intervention started, a significantly smaller proportion of children participating in the program were pulled from school to work for food or money, relative to the control group.
However, there was not a significant difference between the treatment and control group in the proportion of children who attended school or the average number of days missed from school.","Random assignment was compromised for this study because, after randomly assigning the communities to the treatment or control group, the authors note that the household selection process differed by Village Development Group (VDG). Since there were only four VDGs in each of the treatment and the control groups, the selection process may have created systematic differences between the two groups.","",""

The authors suggested three new directions for future research on this topic based on their review of the literature. First, research could investigate the links among parents’ and teachers’ math anxiety, self-efficacy, and teaching self-efficacy and their children’s or students’ attitudes. A second direction involved transmission of gender differences in theories of math intelligence—that is, whether mathematical ability is fixed or can improve through effort. Finally, research has shown that children identify with math gender stereotypes from a young age, but does not yet suggest a mechanism through which children acquire these stereotypes.","","","","","","",""

DMIE was implemented in Hawaii, Kansas, Minnesota, and Texas with the aim of preventing or delaying people with disabilities from leaving the workforce and applying for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits. 
The study was a randomized controlled trial examining DMIE’s impact on employment, earnings, benefit applications and receipt, and health status. Study data sources included the Ticket Research File (TRF), Master Earnings File (MEF), and survey data. Because DMIE recruitment methods, participant populations, and services offered varied substantially across states, the authors reported impacts separately for each state and for Minnesota and Texas pooled together.
With few exceptions, DMIE did not achieve statistically significant impacts on employment, annual earnings, or disability benefit applications. In Hawaii, DMIE participants worked fewer hours and reported fewer instrumental activities of daily living limitations. In Minnesota and Texas, the program reduced federal disability benefit receipt.
The quality of the causal evidence is high for most outcomes examined, which means that we are confident that the estimated impacts are attributable solely to the DMIE. However, for some outcomes, including the hours worked in Hawaii, the quality of the causal evidence is moderate, which means that factors other than DMIE might have contributed to the estimated effects.","","The DMIE, which was authorized under the 1999 Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act and funded by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, aimed to delay or prevent reliance on Social Security disability benefits through medical assistance and other supports. Hawaii, Kansas, Minnesota, and Texas received federal funding to design and test innovative programs to obtain this objective. Each state provided health care services beyond existing health insurance coverage, as well as discounted deductibles, premiums, and copayments. DMIE participants also received employment services and a personal case manager. DMIE enrollment occurred from 2006 through 2008 and varied by state. All DMIE services expired on September 30, 2009.
The age range for eligible participants varied slightly across states but was roughly 18 to 62. Eligible participants also had to work at least 40 hours per month, not have pending disability applications, and neither be receiving Social Security disability benefits nor have pending applications for benefits. Minnesota and Texas recruited low-income residents with severe mental illness from certain parts of the states. In Texas, participants also had to be uninsured and have a physical disability. Kansas recruited statewide to attract participants with both physical and mental disabilities from its high-risk insurance pool and Hawaii recruited people with diabetes who lived in the city and county of Honolulu. Given the different recruitment strategies, participants varied across states in terms of age, marital status, ethnicity, educational attainment, physical and mental capability, and employment characteristics.","The study was a randomized controlled trial examining DMIE’s impact on employment, earnings, benefit applications and receipt, and health status. In Hawaii, 124 eligible participants were randomly assigned to a treatment group eligible to receive DMIE services and 60 were assigned to a control group that could not access DMIE services. The treatment and control group sample size in Kansas was 225 and 275, respectively; in Minnesota it was 888 and 267 respectively; and in Texas it was 888 t and 697 respectively. Because the recruitment methods, participant populations, and services offered varied substantially across sites, the authors reported impacts separately for each of the four sites. The authors found that participants in Minnesota and Texas were similar enough to pool, so they estimated impacts for the two states pooled together.
The authors estimated regression-adjusted impacts from outcomes measured in a follow-up survey administered 12 to 24 months after enrollment (the exact follow-up period varied by state). The survey data included demographic information, self-reported health status, and employment characteristics. In addition, the analysis used data on disabling conditions from the TRF and data on annual earnings from the MEF.","The study found no statistically significant impacts on employment or annual earnings, except in Hawaii, where the program reduced hours worked by 23.9 hours per month.
In Texas (and in the pooled Texas and Minnesota sample) there was a small but statistically significant reduction in SSDI benefit receipt.
DMIE participants in Minnesota had better mental health than control group members, and participants in Hawaii had fewer limitations on activities of daily living than control group members; these differences were statistically significant.","Almost all of the study sample members were employed at baseline, and most control group members remained at work and did not go on to receive Social Security disability benefits during the study period. This brings into question whether the states’ target populations were really at high risk of receiving Social Security disability benefits within the two-year follow-up period.","Honolulu city and county, Hawaii

The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted in the Mchinji district of Malawi. Within the district, eight villages were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control groups. Using survey data, the author compared the child labor and school outcomes of children ages 6-17 in households that received the cash transfer with those that did not receive the cash transfer.
The study found that when compared to the control group, children in the Mchinji SCTPS program had significantly: 1) increased school enrollment; 2) fewer school absences; and 3) worked fewer hours outside of the home. An unexpected finding was that children participating in the Mchinji SCTPS also had significantly higher rates of domestic work when compared to children in the control group.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Mchinji Social Cash Transfer Pilot Scheme and not to other factors.","Absence of Conflict of Interest.","The Mchinji Social Cash Transfer Pilot Scheme (SCTPS; the pilot of the Malawi Social Cash Transfer Scheme) was an unconditional cash transfer program geared toward households that were ultra-poor (i.e., in lowest quintile) and labor constrained (i.e., elderly head of household with no working adults aged 19-64, one adult is responsible for three dependent members, or contains a chronically ill or disabled adult). The program's goal was to alleviate poverty, increase school enrollment, and reduce hunger and malnutrition. Participating households received a monthly cash transfer that was dependent on household size and the number of school-aged children in the home. The monthly transfer amount ranged from $4.30 (USD) for a household of one member to $12.85 (USD) for a household with four members. Households received an additional $1.44 (USD) per month for each child in primary school and $2.88 (USD) per month for each child in secondary school.","The author conducted a randomized controlled trial in the Mchinji district, with eight villages randomly assigned to either the treatment or control conditions. The district provided a roster with all the households who were eligible for the Mchinji SCTPS in the eight villages. The sample included 486 households with 1,193 children aged 6-17 (695 treatment and 498 control). Households in the treatment group received a monthly cash transfer, whereas households in the control group received monetary transfers after the study ended.
Data was collected using a survey with the head of household or other household designee at baseline (March 2007) and follow up (April 2008). For the analysis, the author used a two-level statistical model (children nested in households) to evaluate the effect on child labor and school outcomes. Child labor outcomes included domestic activities (chores inside the home) and economic activities (work outside the home). School outcomes included school enrollment and attendance.","Employment/Child labor
The study found a significant decrease in the number of hours spent in economic activities among children in households receiving the cash transfer compared to the control group. Children in these households worked 21 percent fewer hours in a week than those in the control group. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of participation in additional economic activities or total number of work activities.
Unexpectedly, the study found a significant increase in the number of hours spent in domestic activities among children in households receiving the cash transfer compared to the control group. Children in households receiving the cash transfer worked 19 percent more hours in a week than those in the control group. The rate of participation in domestic activities also significantly increased for those receiving cash transfers, with children participating in 15 percent more domestic activities compared to the control group.
Education (School participation/enrollment)
The study found that children in households receiving the cash transfer had significantly greater odds of being enrolled in school at the year one follow-up compared to children in the control group.
In addition, the study found that children in households receiving the cash transfer missed significantly fewer days of school than those who did not receive the cash transfer. Children in households receiving the cash transfer missed 59 percent fewer days than those in the control group.","The author’s statistical model only included the household and child level to measure effects. However, randomization occurred at the village level. Variation at the village level is not accounted for in the model, so the reported effects and standard errors may not be accurate.
It is also important to note that the treatment was associated with an increase in domestic work activities. CLEAR reviews consider any increases in child labor as an unfavorable outcome.","",""

Success measured as occupation matching.","The study’s objective was to examine the impact of training funded by Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) on dislocated workers’ employment.
The author used a nonexperimental approach to compare the reemployment rate among TAA beneficiaries who completed a TAA-funded training program with that of those who did not complete training, and compared the reemployment rate among those who participated in each type of TAA-funded training with that of those who did not participate in any training, after adjusting for workers’ characteristics.
The study found that, among TAA beneficiaries, completion of a training program was associated with higher reemployment rates. The study also found that participation in TAA-funded customized training was associated with lower reemployment rates, while participation in occupational training or in on-the-job training was associated with higher reemployment rates compared with not participating in training.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the author did not ensure that the groups being compared were similar before the program. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to TAA-funded training; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Established under the Trade Act of 1974 and amended through the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act of 2002, the TAA Program was intended to provide aid to adult workers (18 and older) within an industry or group whose employment had been lost or reduced as a result of foreign trade competition. The available services included employment and case management services, job search assistance and allowances, training, relocation allowances, and some cash income supports. Eligible employees must have lost their jobs or have been notified of unemployment risk because of import competition or shifts in foreign production.
When the Department of Labor certifies that a group of workers have been laid off because of trade, workers expected to benefit from training are enrolled in occupational training and, conditional on their participation in the training, receive income support. TAA funds may support various forms of training, including classroom-based occupational instruction and on-the-job training, and may target a wide range of occupations or industries. Participants choose their training program with the guidance of TAA staff. Workers deemed unlikely to benefit from training may receive income support without participating in training.","The study was based on administrative data from 143,000 dislocated workers who participated in the TAA program from 2005 to 2008. The author used a nonexperimental approach to compare the reemployment rates between TAA beneficiaries who completed a TAA-funded training program with those who did not complete training, and compared the reemployment rates between those who participated in each type of TAA-funded training (occupational, remedial, on-the-job, and customized) with those who did not participate in any training, after adjusting for workers’ characteristics. The study considered a participant reemployed if he or she had employment for at least one quarter during the three quarters following program exit.","Employment. The author found that TAA beneficiaries who completed any type of training program had a reemployment rate that was 4 percentage points higher on average than that of those who did not complete a training program. The author also found that TAA beneficiaries who received occupational skills training had a reemployment rate that was 5 percentage points higher and those who received on-the-job training had a reemployment rate that was 12 percentage points higher on average than that of those who did not receive training. Participation in customized training was associated with a 7 percentage point decrease in the reemployment rate compared with non-trainees.","The author did not adequately account for preexisting differences between the groups’ earnings or employment history before program participation. Therefore, the estimated impacts might reflect preexisting differences between the groups rather than the true impact of the TAA-funded training program. For example, if a worker who participated in training was previously employed for a shorter amount of time than a worker who did not participate in training, this difference in prior employment history could contribute to differences in reemployment rates.","",""

To assess the program’s effects, the authors used a randomized controlled trial in which villages were randomly assigned to the treatment group, which would receive the intervention, and the control group, which would not. Child labor was assessed using household surveys, and schooling outcomes were assessed using household surveys and school records. To understand the program’s impact on child school and work participation, the authors compared change in these outcomes over the first year of the program.
The study found that children participating in the intervention had significantly greater decreases in school absences over one year, relative to the comparison group. In addition, over one year there was a significantly lower increase in the percent of both boys and girls who worked for income if they were in the intervention group rather than the comparison group.

This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Malawi Social Cash Transfer Scheme, but other factors might also have contributed.","Absence of Conflict of Interest.","The Malawi Social Cash Transfer Scheme (SCTS) is an unconditional cash transfer program that aims to increase school attendance and lower child labor among poor households in the district of Mchinji in Malawi. The program was implemented by the government of Malawi, but the study was conducted by Boston University and the University of Malawi. Participating households receive a monthly cash transfer that depends on the number of children and number of people in the household overall, although the transfer averaged $14 (USD) per month. While there were no conditions required to receive cash transfers, participants are encouraged to have their children attend school. The program includes households that are considered ""labor constrained"", which means that either there are no adults 19-64 who can work, or there are more than three dependents per each able adult. To be eligible to participate, households also should be considered ""ultra-poor"", which means that the households are in the lowest fifth of income or below the poverty line. However, in selecting households for the program, the district targeted the 10 percent poorest households that were also labor constrained.","The Mchinji district selected eight villages for the study, and then the authors randomly assigned those villages to the treatment (n=4) and control group (n=4). Intervention households received the monthly cash transfers, and control households did not receive any benefits. The final outcomes analysis included 520 children in the control group, and 722 children in the intervention (treatment) group. The children were aged 6-18 when the baseline survey was completed. For children in the final sample, there were no significant differences at baseline in child age, child gender, or household head education level, although there were significant differences in one indicator of poverty, monthly food expenditures. The school attendance and child labor outcomes, and household demographics were assessed using a survey that authors administered to households as an in-person interview. The authors also verified attendance using school records. The analysis used a difference-in-differences method to compare child labor and attendance outcomes between the treatment and control groups. The analysis compared changes in these outcomes from when the intervention began to a year later. To account for baseline group differences, the analysis controlled for household size and monthly household food expenditures.","Employment/Child labor
Over the year of the intervention, there was a significantly lower percent of boys that participated in paid work in the treatment group (+10 percentage points) versus the control group (+21 percentage points). There was also a significantly lower percent of girls that participated in paid work in the treatment group (+5 percentage points) versus the control group (+14 percentage points) over this time period.
Education (School participation/enrollment)
Over the year of the intervention, the average decrease in number of days absent per month was significantly larger for the treatment group (-1.8 days) than for the control group (-.9 days), indicating that the intervention had a significant, positive effect on school attendance.
While the average increase in the percent enrolled in school (+5 percentage points) was greater for the treatment group than for the control group (0 percentage points) over the intervention year, this effect was not statistically significant.","The authors identified a problem of ""ghost"" household members - those reported who did not exist to get more money in the monthly transfer.

The program sought to help youth with disabilities ages 14 through 25 who lived in 19 specific West Virginia counties to maximize their economic self-sufficiency.
The study examined implementation of Youth Works, focusing on major aspects of service delivery, including the background, local context, and service environment. It provided information on participants’ characteristics and satisfaction with the program. The authors conducted qualitative analysis of staff and participant interviews, including data collected from site visits, and descriptive quantitative analysis of participants’ baseline and follow-up survey data and service utilization data from a management information system.
Overall, the study found that Youth Works faced some substantial challenges, but that all participants received some project services and most received at least one contact for each of the four types of service: benefits planning, employment, education, and case management.
Study findings related to implementation challenges and solutions are potentially applicable to other current or future projects that provide employment-related services to youth with disabilities.","","The West Virginia Youth Works program was one of six project sites evaluated using a randomized design as part of the larger YTD sponsored by the Social Security Administration (SSA), which intended to help youth with disabilities become more self-sufficient and improve their employment outcomes. From April 2008 to March 2012, the Human Resource Development Foundation—a nonprofit employment services provider—collaborated with the Center for Excellence in Disabilities to offer work-readiness assessments and services, job placement, and case management services to young SSA beneficiaries (ages 14 to 25).
All YTD participants were also eligible for waivers that (1) extended the student earned income exclusion to all YTD participants regardless of age, (2) increased the earned income exclusion to a $1 reduction in Supplemental Security Income benefit for every $4 earned above a base amount, and (3) delayed benefit cessation for YTD participants who were determined ineligible for benefits after a benefit review or age-18 Supplemental Security Income medical redetermination.","The implementation portion of the study sought to describe whether the demonstration, as implemented by Youth Works, tested the service intervention as conceived by SSA. In doing so, the study described the major aspects of implementation, including the local context; inputs, resources, and partnerships; service delivery, including dosage; and participants’ characteristics and satisfaction with program services. The study drew on program documents, site visits (including interviews with grantee and subgrantee staff, partner staff, and focus groups with participants and their parents), telephone interviews with project management, service provision data from the program’s management information system, and baseline and 12-month follow-up surveys of participants. The study was conducted from November 2008 through April 2011.","The study found that Youth Works implemented the YTD model as designed, though it faced some substantial challenges. Lack of transportation was a major barrier to employment for participants; the program addressed this by seeking help from vocational rehabilitation providers, using flexible funds to subsidize transportation costs, and helping youth obtain driver’s licenses. The generally weak economy at the time also presented challenges for finding gainful employment for participants. In response, Youth Works offered a comprehensive menu of work-based experiences that served as stepping stones to competitive paid jobs. The project also had difficulty providing services in remote locations; staff overcame this by traveling to participants’ homes, delivering services via telephone, and adapting their responsibilities to respond to participants’ needs.
The program operated in a challenging context, but compensated by employing a strong management team and committed frontline staff. At the time of implementation, West Virginia had the largest share of adults with disabilities in the United States and ranked third among all states in the proportion of youth with disabilities. State residents were economically disadvantaged relative to the rest of the country, and although services existed for youth with disabilities, these services were fragmented, uncoordinated, and limited, with many agencies relying on waiting lists of youth to be served. To implement Youth Works, the grantee established informal partnerships with the state workforce board, the state division for vocational rehabilitation, and other organizations to provide assistance with job search and referrals to social services.
All participants received some project services and most received at least one contact for each of the four major types of service: benefits planning, employment, education, and case management. Virtually all (99 percent) received benefits planning services, which reflects the project’s emphasis on educating youth about work incentives. Overall, 96 percent received employment-related services and 72 percent received some form of education service. Virtually all (99 percent) received case management services; the most common contact was a general check-in. Youth Works staff made 46 service contacts for each participant, for a total of 34 hours of service, and an average of 24 hours of direct service contacts involving youth. In the follow-up survey, nearly one-third of respondents did not recall receiving Youth Works services. Despite this, 58 percent reported that their overall experience with the project was good or very good, and 62 percent reported that project services were somewhat or very useful.","The study clearly identified the research question and topics of interest and explored an array of data sources to explore these topics. It included a systematic description of findings and effectively illustrated findings with case studies, quotes from interviews and focus groups, and descriptive quantitative management information system and survey data. Qualitative and quantitative data were triangulated, but the study did not include a thorough description of data collection, data analysis, and data quality control. The study findings are potentially applicable to other current or future projects that provide employment-related services to youth with disabilities; however, the absence of information on methods and analysis makes it difficult to determine the extent to which the findings reflect the average program experience.","",""

Evidence from Mexico","The study’s objective was to examine the impact of Mexico’s conditional cash transfer program (PROGRESA/Oportunidades) on school enrollment and employment in paid activities for children ages 6 to 18 in urban areas.
The study used a nonexperimental design to evaluate schooling and work outcomes from PROGRESA/Oportunidades program 1 and 2 years after implementation in urban areas.
The study found that PROGRESA/Oportunidades was significantly related to reduced labor rates for boys who were 12-14 in the first and second year, and girls ages 15 to 18 in the first year. The program was also significantly related to an increase in school enrollment for boys and girls.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is low because the authors did not ensure that the groups were similar before program participation. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to PROGRESA/Oportunidades; other factors are likely to have contributed.","Absence of conflict of interest.","The PROGRESA/Oportunidades program started in Mexican rural areas in 1997 and was modified and renamed Oportunidades in 2000. It has gradually expanded to urban areas. The program provides monthly conditional cash transfers to five million families. The cash transfer is conditional upon child school attendance and health clinic visits for family members. The amount of the cash transfer varies by gender and increases with the grade of the child. However, if a child repeats a grade twice, he or she will permanently lose the cash transfer.","In this study, authors used the Urban Evaluation Survey that was collected in 2002 prior to the announcement and start of the cash transfer, and follow-up data 1 year in 2003 and 2 years in 2004 post-implementation. The study utilizes a difference-in-differences propensity score matching design, which compares the changes in the outcomes of interest for the treatment group participating families with the outcomes for a matched set of program nonparticipants from the comparison group. The data included 2,972 households who were eligible, 2,556 households who were eligible and did not participate, and 3,607 households who were eligible but resided in areas that were not implementing the program.","Employment/Child labor 
The study found a statistically significant relationship between PROGRESA/Oportunidades and a decrease in child labor. Boys ages 12-14 in 2002 had decreased labor rates of about 8 percentage points in year 1 and 12-14 percentage points in year two. The program reduced child labor for girls ages 15 to 18 by 11 percentage points in year one.
Education (School participation/enrollment) 
The study found a statistically significant relationship between PROGRESA/Oportunidades and an increase in school enrollment for boys and girls ages 8 to 11, with a 2 to 3 percentage point increase in enrollment for the 1 and 2 year program impacts.","The authors created a matched group of non-participating households to compare to PROGRESA/Oportunidades participating-households. However, the authors did not account for the outcomes at baseline, such as previous school attendance or child labor. Preexisting differences between the groups—and not the program/intervention itself— could explain the observed differences in outcomes.","",""

The study uses a nonexperimental design to compare the outcomes of TAA recipients with a comparison group of nonrecipients who were also displaced from manufacturing jobs during the same period as the treatment group.
The study found no statistically significant relationship between TAA participation and employment or earnings when comparing TAA recipients with displaced workers who did not participate in TAA. However, when comparing the TAA recipients who received training with recipients who did not receive training, the study found a significant relationship between training and employment and earnings.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is low because the authors did not sufficiently account for potential differences between the study groups. This means we are not confident that estimated effects are attributable to the TAA program; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Established under the Trade Act of 1974 and amended through the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act of 2002, the TAA Program provided aid to adult workers (18 and older) within an industry or group whose employment had been lost or reduced as a result of foreign trade competition. The available services included employment and case management services, job search assistance and allowances, training, relocation allowances, and some cash income supports. Eligible employees must have lost their jobs or have been notified of unemployment risk because of import competition or shifts in foreign production.","The study authors used a statistical approach called propensity-score matching to compare the outcomes of displaced manufacturing workers receiving TAA with a demographically similar group of displaced workers who did not receive services. The variables used for matching included import sensitivity, intra-industry trade, unionization rate, average industry wage, industry layoffs, state unemployment rate, individual age, gender, education, and prior employment length. The authors used a similar approach in a separate subsample analysis to compare the outcomes of TAA recipients who received training with a comparable group of TAA recipients who did not receive training. The authors assessed impacts on both employment and earnings.","Employment. The study found no statistically significant relationship between participation in the TAA program and employment. However, for the subsample of TAA recipients who received training versus recipients who did not receive training, the study found that those who participated in training were 10 to 13 percentage points more likely to be reemployed than those who did not participate in training.
Earnings. The study found no statistically significant relationship between participation in the TAA program and earnings. However, for the subsample of TAA recipients who received training versus recipients who did not receive training, the study found that those who participated in training were 9 to 11 percentage points less likely to have an earnings loss than those who did not participate in training.","Although the authors used propensity-score matching to create treatment and comparison groups with similar characteristics (including age, gender, employment, and industry-level earnings), the authors did not account for potential differences between the groups in terms of race, ethnicity, or earnings before TAA participation. Therefore, the estimated impacts could reflect differences in the characteristics of the groups rather than the true impact of the TAA program itself.","",""

The authors administered an online study to second-year or higher undergraduate students in the engineering, life sciences, and psychology departments of a large research university in the midwestern United States. They used regression analysis to identify beliefs and personality traits that predict interest in engineering research careers for male and female students.
The study found that having a “Thing Orientation”—a predisposition to focus on objects and their manipulation instead of a tendency to notice and identify with others’ emotions—significantly predicts research interest and has a greater association with research interest among female engineering students than among their male classmates.
The authors also sought to discover the pathway through which Thing Orientation promotes interest in a research career by identifying associations between Thing Orientation and beliefs about research. For the female students in this sample, Thing Orientation was positively associated with the beliefs that research is innovative and transformative, requires repetitive lab work, and calls for creativity and collaboration. In turn, these beliefs affect female engineering students’ interest in research careers; the belief that research is innovative and transformative is positively associated with interest in a research career.","","","","","","",""

The study found that employment rates were 8.6 percentage points higher among RA participants than those completing none of the program both six and nine years after program enrollment.

Therefore, the review of this study was conducted by an independent consultant trained in applying the CLEAR causal evidence guidelines.","RA is a career-training program that offers on-the-job training, combined with technical instruction tailored to the industry of the job. As participants attain relevant skills, they receive incremental wage increases. Upon program completion, participants earned a nationally recognized certification. At the time of this study, RAs ranged in duration from one to six years, with positions in about 1,000 occupations, such as electrician, plumber, truck driver, child care worker, and correctional officer.
The Employment and Training Administration’s Office of Apprenticeship (OA) within the United States Department of Labor, along with independent State Apprenticeship Agencies, oversees the RA program nationwide. OA recruits employers and employer associations to register and implement apprenticeship programs and to recruit participants. Employers cover the costs of training and wages paid to apprentices.","Using data from Unemployment Insurance wage records, the authors compared those who had completed the RA program with those who completed none of the program, either because they were eligible but did not enroll or because they were eligible and enrolled, but did not participate in any activities. The authors referred to those who completed none of the program as nonparticipants.

The study used regression analysis to compare firms’ actual levels of employment in 2005 with the levels of employment predicted by their characteristics before receiving the Phase II award.
The study found no statistically significant relationships between SBIR funding and firms’ employment.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to SBIR funding; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Established in 1982, the SBIR program was a competitive awards-based program with the goal of encouraging technological innovation among domestic small businesses. Each year, federal agencies with external research and development budgets that exceeded $100 million were required to allocate 2.8 percent of their research and development budget to their own SBIR programs. The program was structured in three phases. The objective of the first phase was to enable small businesses to evaluate the technical merit, commercial potential, and feasibility of a proposed project. Phase II awards were intended for businesses to continue the efforts begun in Phase I and further develop their proposed projects. Businesses pursued further work and commercialization in Phase III; however, SBIR funds were not involved in this phase. The study examined the impact of receiving a Phase II award on subsequent firm employment.","The study used data from a survey conducted by the National Research Council in 2005 on 11,214 small firms that received SBIR Phase II awards made from 1992 to 2001. Employment data covered two points in time: when the Phase II award was given and when the survey was conducted in 2005. To estimate the impact of receiving a Phase II award, the authors compared firms’ actual levels of employment in 2005 with the levels of employment predicted by their characteristics before receiving the award.","The study found no statistically significant relationships between SBIR funding and firm employment.","The authors examined only firms that received Phase II awards. Instead of comparing these firms to a comparison group of firms that did not receive awards, they used characteristics of the firms before the award to predict how employment at the firms would have changed in the absence of the award. Because the firm served as its own control, the CLEAR guidelines require that authors examine the outcome at multiple time points before the intervention to rule out the possibility of selection into the intervention due to trends in the outcome. This study measured the number of employees at only one time point before award receipt, so it does not meet the criteria for a moderate or high rating.
Furthermore, the analyses included controls for firm characteristics, but these characteristics might have differed among firms receiving Phase II awards and firms not receiving awards, so the characteristics of firms receiving awards might not predict employment at firms not receiving awards. Any findings could reflect differences in these characteristics as well as any effects of the intervention.
The authors noted that the response rates to the survey data used in the analysis were low (23 to 36 percent), although they attempted to control for nonresponse bias in their model. Thus, findings might not be generalizable to the full sample of firms receiving Phase II awards.","",""

The author used a randomized controlled trial to assign former prisoners to the transitional jobs program or to a group that was offered job search assistance and compared the two groups’ employment and earnings outcomes two years after random assignment, controlling for participants’ characteristics before random assignment.
The study found that members of the transitional jobs group were significantly more likely (by 29 percentage points) than control group members to be employed at any point during the two years after random assignment.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the TJRD, and not to other factors.","","The transitional jobs program provided former prisoners in Chicago, Illinois; Detroit, Michigan; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and St. Paul, Minnesota with 30 to 40 hours of temporary paid employment weekly, job search assistance, and other supports, including job coaching and classes before employment. Participants in later cohorts in the Milwaukee and St. Paul sites also received bonuses (up to $1,500) for obtaining and retaining unsubsidized employment. Participants began reporting to their temporary jobs within two weeks of random assignment. The program offered 90 days of subsidized employment, with the option to extend as slots were available.
The program was offered to men aged 18 and older who had been released from prison within the previous 90 days, were interested in and available for full-time employment, and had not participated in transitional employment within the previous year.","The program recruited and randomly assigned 1,813 eligible ex-offenders either to TJRD or to a control group that was offered job search assistance. Employment and earnings data were collected quarterly from state Unemployment Insurance and transitional job site records for two years after random assignment. The authors estimated program impacts by comparing regression-adjusted means and percentages between the treatment and control group members.","The study found that treatment group members were significantly more likely (by 29 percentage points) than control group members to be employed at any point during the two years after random assignment.","Although transitional jobs group members exhibited positive gains in overall employment, the subsidized employment that the transitional jobs program offered largely drove these findings. Treatment group members were employed in unsubsidized jobs at the same rate as the control group members by the end of the two-year follow-up period.","",""

The goal of the conference, which was held at a large metropolitan, public university in central Florida, was to encourage young girls to consider STEM careers.
The authors administered a single questionnaire to conference attendees that asked about attendees’ knowledge of and interest in STEM before and after the conference. The survey was included in backpacks distributed at the beginning of the day, and participants were reminded to complete it at the end of the day. Of the 214 middle school girls and 103 parent attendees, 80 percent of the girls and 37 percent of the parents turned in a completed survey.
The authors did not conduct any statistical tests to measure changes in knowledge of and interest in STEM before and after participating in the conference.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors measured pre-intervention knowledge of and interest in STEM after participation in the intervention, which may be subject to recall bias. This means we are not confident that any estimated effects would be attributable to the Expanding Your Horizons (EYH) conference, but other factors are likely to have contributed. Further, the authors did not conduct statistical analysis to measure whether observed changes in outcomes were actually significant.","","The annual EYH conference, held at the University of Central Florida (UCF), encourages young girls to consider careers in STEM. The target population for the conference is middle school girls in grades 6–8 and their parents. The authors studied the 2011 conference, which consisted of five hands-on engineering workshops and featured guest speakers who discussed STEM career paths and engineering concepts. EYH is a nationwide program that started in 1974, and the annual conference has been held at UCF since 1982.","The study used a nonexperimental design that compared 172 middle school girls’ post-conference questionnaire responses about their interest in and knowledge of STEM careers after attending the conference. The questionnaire asked respondents about their attitudes toward STEM before and after the conference so that changes in attitudes could be measured using only one post-test survey. No tests for statistical significance were conducted.","The authors did not conduct any statistical tests to measure changes in knowledge of and interest in STEM for parents or their children before and after participating in the conference.","The authors attempted to compare changes in knowledge of and interest in STEM by using a single post-test survey that asked about attitudes before and after conference attendance. There are concerns about the validity of the responses for pre-program knowledge and attitudes because most conference attendees presumably completed the survey at the end of the conference and were asked to recall what their attitudes were before the conference. It is likely that the “pre-conference” measure may have been affected by the conference experience itself. Furthermore, CLEAR’s guidelines require that the authors observe outcomes for multiple periods before the intervention to rule out the possibility that participants had increasing or decreasing trends in the outcomes examined before conference attendance. We would expect that people who chose to attend a STEM conference would have high baseline attitudes to begin with, which could influence the anticipated impact of conference attendance.","",""

The activities took place at a 2006 Society of Women Engineers-sponsored event and included designing and constructing a vehicle and assembling an electrical circuit.
The author conducted statistical analyses to compare self-reported career interests of girls who participated in the hands-on activities and those who did not, as measured by a program-administered survey.
The study found that participation in the hands-on activities was positively related to increased interest in becoming an engineer or technologist.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the hands-on activities; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Treatment participants completed two 45-minute hands-on activities: designing and constructing a vehicle in pairs, and individually assembling and operating an electrical circuit. They also participated in other learning activities that are not hands-on. The activities were held at an annual technology event in California in 2006, sponsored by the Society of Women Engineers.","The study included 72 middle school-age girls and featured a nonexperimental design to measure interest in engineering for those who participated in hands-on activities compared with those who did not, as well as changes in outcomes over time for participants before and after the intervention. The study design included two treatment groups and two control groups, with one of each group completing both pre- and post-tests, and the other groups completing only post-tests. The two treatment groups and first control group included a random sample of participants from the 2006 Society of Women Engineers-sponsored event in California; the second control group (whose members completed both the pre- and post-tests) comprised a convenience sample of Color Guard participants from New York who presumably had limited exposure to technology-based hands-on activities. The author administered surveys both before and after the technology event to one treatment and one control group, asking students to answer the following question: “How interested are you in becoming an engineer or technologist?” Responses used a rating scale that ranged from not interested to very interested.","The study found that treatment students had higher levels of interest in becoming an engineer or technologist compared with students in the control group.","The author did not control for students’ age, race, or ethnicity in the analyses, thus the study did not demonstrate that the groups were comparable before the intervention. Further, by design, some of the study participants did not take a pre-test, thus the author was unable to control for baseline attitudes for these students.","",""

This study used data from junior and senior colleges within a major urban university system to compare outcomes of a treatment group of JD program participants and a comparison group of transfers into the urban university system from other, nonparticipating community colleges.
This study found that first- and second-year retention rates were higher for JD program participants than for transfers from other community colleges, but did not conduct statistical tests of these differences.

JD students received dual admission to the community college as well as the senior college, and transitioned into the upper division of the baccalaureate engineering program at the senior college upon successful completion of lower-division courses and degree requirements at the community college.

Curricular learning communities enroll cohorts of students in sets of two or three linked courses.
The study used student survey and administrative enrollment data in a quasi-experimental design in which the treatment group enrolled in the basic skills curricular learning communities and the comparison group did not enroll in the learning communities but took other, similar courses.
The study found that students enrolled in the basic skills curricular learning communities were 1.27 times more likely to be enrolled in a postsecondary educational institution in the year following program enrollment, compared with students not enrolled in learning communities.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the author did not include sufficient controls in the analysis. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to basic skills curricular learning communities. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","In the basic skills curricular learning communities, a cohort of students enrolled in the same set of two or three linked courses. Instructors for the linked courses worked together to create an interdisciplinary learning environment, making connections in content across the linked courses. These learning communities aimed to bolster connections between students and build a sense of community through students attending multiple classes with the same group of peers.
This study included 13 community colleges in eight states: 4 colleges in California; 3 in Washington; and 1 each in Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and North Carolina. These community colleges offered basic skills curricular learning communities specifically designed for academically underprepared students, or students whose placement test scores or academic history indicated they might struggle to complete college-level courses. All schools in the sample had a history of successful learning communities and served at-risk students (first generation college, minority, or nontraditional students, and so on). At these schools, eligible students enrolled in basic skills and general education courses together as a cohort. The intervention lasted at least one semester or quarter, depending on the school.","This study used a quasi-experimental design. Colleges were selected through an application process, and all students at those colleges enrolled in basic skills curricular learning communities in fall 2003 were selected for participation in the study as the treatment group. Coordinators at the community colleges identified courses that covered similar content and had students with similar characteristics to the treatment group. All of the students enrolled in the similar courses in fall 2003 were assigned to the comparison group. The author used data from the National Student Clearinghouse for enrollment information and from a modified version of the Community College Survey of Student Engagement for background information and reported engagement with instructors and classmates. The author used student survey data from fall 2003 and administrative enrollment data from fall 2004. In total, 6,272 students made up the full sample, and 3,733 responded to the survey. The author estimated regression models comparing the outcomes of treatment and control group members, controlling for demographic and other characteristics.","The study found that students enrolled in the basic skills curricular learning communities were 1.27 times more likely to be enrolled in a postsecondary educational institution the following year, compared with students not enrolled in the learning communities. This difference was statistically significant.","The author used multivariate regressions to measure the relationship between participating in the curricular learning communities and students’ persistence. The regressions controlled for students’ demographic characteristics, the institution’s academic calendar system (semester or quarter), and pre-intervention socioeconomic status and academic achievement. However, the author did not control for the state in which the community college was located. This lack of statistical controls raises concerns that factors other than participation in basic skills curricular learning communities could account for the observed differences in persistence between treatment and comparison students. For example, differences in state education policies could lead to differences in students’ persistence, regardless of participation in curricular learning communities. Therefore, the study is not eligible for a moderate causal evidence rating, the highest rating available for nonexperimental designs.","",""

The authors conducted three separate randomized experiments. In experiments 1 and 2, individuals completed math puzzles and were asked to report the number of puzzles they completed, as well as their expenses for traveling to the site where the experiment was conducted. In experiment 3, individuals acquiring a new car insurance policy were asked to report their current cars’ odometer readings on an insurance form. In each experiment, individuals were randomly assigned either to receive a form requiring a signature at the top, or to receive a form requiring a signature at the bottom.
The study found that, across the three experiments, participants who signed at the top of the form were less likely to respond dishonestly than participants who signed the form at the bottom or did not sign the form at all.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on three well-implemented randomized controlled trials. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the placement of the signature line on the forms, and not to other factors.","","","The authors conducted three experiments, two in a laboratory setting and one in the field. In experiments 1 and 2, university students and employees completed math puzzles and then reported on a form designed to look like a typical tax form how many they completed. Participants received a cash incentive for each puzzle that they reported completing. They also reported their time and commuting costs for traveling to the lab and were reimbursed for some of these expenses.
In experiment 1, 101 individuals were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) tax form with a signature line at the top; (2) tax form with a signature line at the bottom; or (3) tax form with no signature line. In experiment 2, 60 individuals were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (1) tax form with a signature line at the top, or (2) tax form with a signature line at the bottom.
In experiments 1 and 2, the authors compared the actual number of completed puzzles and the number of puzzles that individuals reported completing on the tax form. The authors considered any difference between the actual and reported number of puzzles as a result of dishonesty. They also compared the average reported expenses across experimental groups; they assumed that if one group reported higher expenses than the other, resulting in higher reimbursement rates, that group was dishonestly inflating their actual expenses.
In the third experiment, 13,488 existing car insurance customers who were acquiring a new car insurance policy had to report current odometer readings of all vehicles under the existing policy. The authors randomly assigned individuals to either sign next to the statement: “I promise that the information I am providing is true” on the top of the form or on bottom of the form. Previously reported odometer readings for the cars (from insurance records) were subtracted from the newly-reported odometer readings to calculate average mileage driven per car, which was then compared with the group that signed the statement at the top of the form and the group that signed the statement at the bottom of the form. The authors assumed that if one group reported lower average mileage than the other, this indicated the group was dishonestly misreporting its mileage.","The study found that, across the three experiments, participants who signed at the top of the form were less likely to respond dishonestly than participants who signed the form at the bottom or did not sign the form at all.

The study did not find any significant differences between CEO program participants and the control group in Year 2 or Year 3 on any employment or earnings outcomes.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to CEO program, and not to other factors.","","The CEO transitional job program was a comprehensive program that focused on employment strategies for former prisoners. The CEO was one of four sites in the Enhanced Services for the Hard-to-Employ Demonstration and Evaluation Project, sponsored and funded by four separate federal government agencies (the Administration for Children and Families, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the U.S. Department of Labor).
CEO program participants took part in an initial five-day pre-employment life skills course followed by immediate placement into a transitional job at one of more than 30 work sites throughout New York City. Participants worked at the transitional job for four of five days during the work week. The fifth day was reserved for appointments during which participants met with job coaches and job developers, attended specialized programs such as the Responsible Fatherhood Program, and had access to other resources at the CEO program office. Study participants were paid each afternoon of their workday at the job site. The participants received minimum wage for transitional employment hours. The program participants worked with job developers to move into permanent jobs when the participants were considered job-ready on the basis of work site performance and presentation skills or prior employment history. Post-placement services included tracking of employment status and an incentive program introduced midway through the enrollment period in which participants who continued to be employed received financial incentives such as gift cards and transit benefits","The authors conducted a randomized controlled trial, randomly assigning 977 people to either the CEO group or to a control group, which received a shorter life skills course and basic job searching assistance without a transitional job. A total of 568 former prisoners were randomly selected to receive CEO program services. The study excluded those who participated in the CEO or similar program within the past year. The study used administrative data on criminal history from the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services and the New York City Department of Correction, and data from the National Directory of New Hires and the New York State Department of Labor to measure employment in jobs covered by unemployment insurance in the three years before and after entry into the study, and program data from the CEO management information system.
The authors used regression analyses to estimate the impact of the CEO program on earnings and employment one, two, and three years after random assignment. The analyses accounted for several pre-random assignment characteristics, including age, gender, race and ethnicity, number of quarters employed in the three years before random assignment, and number of prior felony convictions.","The study did not find any significant differences between CEO program participants and the control group in Year 2 or Year 3 on any employment or earnings outcomes.","Because subsidized jobs were provided for CEO program participants during the first year, this profile does not report outcomes in subsidized employment or those in the first year. In addition, the post-placement program’s financial incentives were implemented too late for many of the CEO participants to claim. Finally, the study authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to employment and earnings. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","",""

In addition, the study presented examples of promising strategies to encourage low-income women and student parents to participate in STEM education at community colleges.
To assess the involvement of low-income women and student parents in STEM fields at community colleges, the author analyzed publicly available data, including data from the U.S. Department of Labor and the National Center for Education Statistics at the U.S. Department of Education. The author also completed a review of existing programs at community colleges that encourage low-income women and student parents to participate in STEM fields, and consulted with 16 experts to formulate suggestions for additional programs to support these students in STEM fields.
The study found that in the 2008–2009 school year, women earned 22 percent of associate’s degrees awarded in STEM fields—a 7 percentage point reduction in the proportion of STEM associate degrees earned by women eight years earlier. The study also found that, in 2008, roughly one-third of community college students were parents and student parents with children younger than 12 who ultimately earned a baccalaureate or master’s degree in a STEM field were more likely to have attended a community college at some point than students without young children.
Given the decline in women’s share of STEM associate degrees earned over the study observation period, as well as the high proportion of student parents in STEM fields who attend community colleges (compared with students without young children), the author highlighted potential strategies to increase and improve the involvement of low-income women and student parents in STEM fields at community colleges, including targeted recruitment, financial support, child care services, strong developmental education options, and specific counseling and academic support for women. These recommendations were informed by information gathered from existing programs and consultation with experts.","","","","","","",""

In addition, the authors tested a second hypothesis that women’s GPA advantage was driven by institution type, with larger advantages existing at institutions offering specific programs supporting women in science and engineering, compared with institutions without such programs.
The authors used data from the Integrated Postsecondary Data System and from a survey of 499 university and college registrars in the United States to examine the academic performance of undergraduate students in biology, the physical sciences, and engineering from 1984 to 2000. They used regression models to compare the GPAs of male and female students over time both across and within the three fields, controlling for the percentage of female majors, degree recipients, and faculty within each field at each institution in a given year.
The study found that women’s GPAs across the three fields were, on average, 0.1 points (on a 4.0-point scale) higher than men’s during the study period. The study also found that in the physical sciences field, the percentage of female degree recipients was significantly associated with women’s GPA advantage—when more women earned degrees in physical sciences, the GPA advantaged diminished; however, this finding did not hold in the biology or engineering fields.
The study found that the strongest predictor of women’s GPA advantage across fields was the type of institution, with a larger advantage occurring at nonresearch institutions compared with research institutions.

Clients worked with case managers whose caseloads had been reduced to 25 to 30 cases. Participation in Tier 2 was mandatory and could be enforced by sanctioning TANF benefits. Case managers performed detailed assessments of clients to identify the underlying challenges affecting them and their families and then referred clients to services that addressed those challenges. Clients had access to education or job training programs but were required to work 20 hours per week concurrently with participation in such programs. Clients searched for jobs for up to six weeks, and those still unemployed at the end of that period were placed in either unpaid employment or supported employment in which their paid employment was paired with job coaching or on-the-job training.","The authors conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of the Tier 2 program on employment, earnings, and receipt of public assistance. From January 2002 to April 2003, 1,692 eligible Tier 1 recipients were randomly assigned to enroll in Tier 2 or remain in Tier 1; half were randomly assigned to each condition. All sample members were unemployed single parents who had received TANF benefits for at least 12 months. The vast majority of participants were female (93.2 percent), and most were African American (67.8 percent). Nearly 70 percent had received Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) or TANF benefits for more than two years, and about one-third described themselves as suffering from health problems.

These clients did not have severe-enough limitations to be eligible for federal disability benefits, but they did have significant barriers to employment. The PRIDE program screened for potentially eligible clients, conducted an in-depth assessment of their needs, and finally assigned clients to work placements. There were two types of work placements. The vocational rehabilitation participants were required to engage in unpaid work placements specifically designed to accommodate health conditions.

The authors attempted to implement a randomized controlled trial, but they used a process that resulted in nonrandom assignment.

However, the study did not find statistically siginificant effects.","","The goal of the SACM program was to identify public assistance clients with substance abuse problems and provide them with supportive services so that they could find and maintain employment and self-sufficiency. The New York City-based program screened Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) recipients for substance abuse problems. Clinically oriented program staff such as social workers then conducted a two- to three-hour substance abuse assessments to determine the type of substance abuse treatment needed and the client’s readiness to participate in employment-related services. Case managers referred clients to treatment and supportive services, monitored clients’ progress, and referred clients to welfare-to-work activities when treatment was complete. Participation in the in-depth assessment and substance abuse treatment was mandatory; failure to attend could result in cancellation of benefits.","The authors designed the study as a randomized controlled trial; however, the referral process resulted in nonrandom assignment. More than 8,800 TANF and Safety Net recipients whose application questionnaires indicated possible substance abuse were referred via an electronic scheduling system to New York City’s Human Resources Administration for more detailed assessments. When the SACM program had available slots, the automated scheduling system referred applicants to the program. Otherwise, applicants were referred to services-as-usual treatment. The full sample was 70 percent male, with 80 percent ages 31 or older. Fewer than one-third had been employed in the previous year, and most had received cash assistance (50 percent) or food stamps (62 percent) over that period.
The authors estimated the impact of SACM using regression analysis. They analyzed data collected from New York City public assistance records and Unemployment Insurance wage records for New York State.","The study found no statistically significant relationships between the SACM program and employment, earnings, or public assistance receipt after two years.","The referral process presented a problem for randomization because new SACM slots always became available in the morning. Thus, in instances of systematic differences between applicants who applied for appointments in the morning and those who applied in the afternoon, the assignment mechanism would not generate equivalent groups. For example, those eager to engage in treatment and return to work could be more likely to appear for scheduling early in the morning. In addition, staff might have known that the probability of assignment to the SACM group was higher in the morning and thus encouraged participants, who in their opinion needed extra help, to show up earlier rather than later. The study authors argued that such probabilities were remote but presented evidence of differences between the groups and acknowledged that the assignment process was not entirely random. Because the integrity of the random assignment process was compromised, the study was reviewed as a quasi-experimental comparison group design.","",""

The study was a randomized controlled trial that compared outcomes of the treatment and control groups during the program semester and the subsequent semester. The primary data source was transcript data from the colleges.
The study found that students assigned to the Learning Communities Demonstration at Merced attempted and earned more developmental English credits in the program semester than students in the control group. The study did not find any statistically significant impacts of the learning communities at CCBC.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Learning Communities Demonstration, and not to other factors.","","Six community colleges across the United States implemented the National Center for Postsecondary Research Learning Communities Demonstration from 2007 to 2009. It was designed to test whether learning communities were effective at improving academic performance among community college students in need of developmental courses. This study reported findings from the Learning Communities Demonstration at Merced and CCBC.
At Merced, first-time or returning students who placed into developmental reading or writing no lower than three levels below entry-level college English were eligible to participate in the learning communities program. In the learning communities, a developmental English writing course was linked with a developmental reading or math course, a college-level course, or a student success course. Students took both classes together as a cohort and their instructors worked together to integrate the curriculum across the two courses.
At CCBC, first-time or returning students who placed into the highest-level developmental English course (that is, one level below entry-level college English) were eligible to participate in the learning communities program. In the learning communities, the developmental English course was linked with a college-level content course such as psychology, sociology, or speech. Students took both classes together as a cohort and their instructors worked together to integrate the curriculum across the two courses. The learning communities at CCBC also included a master learner seminar, which provided students an extra hour of classroom instruction each week to support their coursework in the learning community.","To be eligible for the study, students were required to have placed into developmental English and to be available to take one of the learning communities at the scheduled time. Students were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which could participate in the learning community, or the control group. At Merced, control group participants were encouraged to enroll in a developmental English course, but were not required to do so. At CCBC, control group participants were subject to the normal college rules, which required that students who qualified for developmental English take such a course in order to register for other courses.
The authors used transcript data provided by the colleges to measure registration rates; the number of credits attempted and earned by students; and their successful completion of the English sequence courses, which included developmental English plus the first college-level English course. For each college, the authors estimated regression models comparing the outcomes of treatment and control group members during the program semester and for one semester following the program. The regression models controlled for the cohort in which students entered the study and reading and writing placement test scores.","The study found that students assigned to a learning community at Merced attempted 1.1 more developmental English credits than control group students during the program semester and cumulatively through the first postprogram semester. These differences were statistically significant.
Learning community students at Merced also earned significantly more (0.9) developmental English credits in the program semester than control group students.
There were no statistically significant differences between treatment and control students at CCBC.","The authors estimated the effect of being offered the opportunity to participate in the learning community. Only 54 percent of students randomly assigned to the treatment group at Merced actually enrolled in a learning community during the program semester. Therefore, the estimated effects of the program at Merced could understate what could have been achieved had more students actually enrolled in the program. At CCBC, 75 percent of those offered the opportunity to participate in the learning community actually enrolled in it.","",""

In this program, students who otherwise would have taken a developmental English course instead took English 101, as well as an eight-person companion course designed to help the students pass English 101.
With student-level, college administrative data, the authors used regression models and propensity score matching to compare outcomes of ALP students to those of comparison students in traditional courses.
The study found that ALP students were more likely than comparison students to attempt and complete college-level English courses, persist to the next year, and attempt and complete more credits. However, ALP students were less likely to earn a certificate degree than comparison students.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it was based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the ALP, but other factors might also have contributed.","","In the Community College of Baltimore County’s ALP, students who otherwise would have taken an upper-level developmental English course instead took English 101. Simultaneously, these students also participated in an eight-person, three-credit companion course designed to help them pass English 101. This course was taught by the same instructor and met during the class period following English 101. Any student who was eligible for the developmental English course had the option to sign up for ALP instead.","Using student-level, college administrative data from 2007–2010, the authors used regression models to compare 592 ALP students to 5,545 students in traditional courses. The authors repeated the approach after using propensity score matching to identify the students in the traditional courses who were the best matches for each of the 592 students in the treatment group. Students were matched based on demographics, enrollment characteristics, placement test scores, and socioeconomic level. Outcomes were measured one year after the end of participating in ALP and during fall 2011, which was one to four years after ALP students had completed the program.","ALP students were 41.7 percentage points more likely to attempt, and 31.3 percentage points more likely to complete, English 101 by fall 2011.
ALP students were 29.4 percentage points more likely to attempt, and 18.5 percentage points more likely to complete, English 102 by fall 2011.
ALP students were 10.5 percentage points more like to persist to the next year (measured in fall 2011) but 0.9 percentage points less likely to earn a certificate degree by fall 2011.
Additionally, ALP students attempted 3.6 more credits and completed 2.4 more college credits after developmental English (measured in fall 2011).","Study authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to progress toward degree completion.

The study used school records to compare a treatment group of developmental education students who were living on campus and assigned to a learning community with a comparison group of students who lived off campus and did not participate in a learning community.
The study found no significant differences in outcomes between the treatment and comparison groups.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the author did not control for preexisting differences between the treatment and comparison groups. This means we would not be confident that any estimated effects would be attributable to learning communities. However, the study found no statistically significant effects.","","Students living in residence halls were assigned to learning communities based on their room assignments. In addition to taking developmental courses, students participating in learning communities attended a semester-long course that included study sessions and academic and career guidance.","Study participants were first-time, full-time students who had completed developmental courses and had an American College Test score of less than 18, or a Scholastic Achievement Test score of less than 870. Students who chose to live in a residence hall (and were therefore assigned to a learning community) comprised the treatment group, while those who chose to live off-campus (and were therefore not assigned to a learning community) comprised the comparison group. Using school records, the author followed a cohort from fall 2006 through spring 2010 and compared the outcomes of the treatment and comparison students.","The study found no statistically significant difference in the number of credits earned between the treatment and comparison groups and did not test for a statistically significant difference in degree completion after four years.","Assignment to the treatment group was based on residential choice—students living in a residence hall formed the treatment group, and students living off campus made up the comparison group. On- and off-campus students could differ in ways other than their participation in learning communities that also might influence their later academic achievement and persistence. For example, on-campus students could have had lower previous academic achievement than off-campus students and therefore sought the support found in an on-campus setting; or off-campus students might be more confident about their abilities and therefore avoid the on-campus residential setting. The author did not include controls for students’ characteristics in the analysis, so any differences in outcomes between the groups, or lack thereof, could reflect preexisting differences between the groups being compared and not impacts of the program.","",""

The authors analyzed data from the High School and Beyond Study (1980s), the National Education Longitudinal Study (1990s), and the Educational Longitudinal Study (2000s) to determine whether gender was correlated with college major choice, after controlling for three different measures of prior academic achievement.
The study found that female students were approximately 20 percentage points less likely to declare a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) major than male students. However, prior achievement in math and science, as measured by GPA, average standardized test scores, and position along the test score distribution, did very little to explain this gender gap.
The study found that girls’ higher performance in English versus math and science only somewhat accounted for the gender gap in college major choice. Factors such as ethnicity and socioeconomic status were more influential.","","","","","","",""

The intervention group consisted of 1,077 inmates who received federal funding to attend correctional education programs before release and were released from IDOC custody during the period 2002–2009. The comparison group included 1,078 individuals who did not receive federal funding for education programs and were randomly selected from a larger pool of sample members released from IDOC in 2005. Most sample members were men (about 85 percent) and Caucasian (65 percent), between the ages of 20 and 39 (77 percent), and had a high school diploma or GED (80 percent).
The study examined the effect of correctional education on participants’ employment, earnings, and recidivism post-release. Employment and earnings were measured in the first quarter of 2008 through the second quarter of 2009. To compare outcomes, the authors compared the raw, unadjusted percentages in different categories (for example, employed or not employed, percentage employed in cumulative quarters, categorical earnings in quarters). The impacts on recidivism were estimated using a statistical model that controlled for race, gender, age, education level, and employment status.","Employment
Individuals who participated in correctional education programs were less likely to be employed since release than individuals who did not attend correctional education programs while incarcerated (the comparison group). This outcome was not tested statistically.
Earnings
Among individuals who were employed, those in the comparison group were less likely to earn more than $1,000 in each quarter. This outcome was not tested statistically.
Recidivism
Individuals who participated in correctional education programs were significantly less likely to recidivate than individuals who did not attend correctional education programs while incarcerated (the comparison group).","Time of release from prison differed between the intervention and comparison groups and this could have affected the observed outcomes. Intervention group members were released from prison between 2002 and 2009, while comparison group members were released in 2005. Thus, an intervention group member released before 2005 had a greater period of time to reoffend. Alternately, an intervention group member released in 2007–2009 would have re-entered society during a recession, which may have negatively impacted his or her labor market success.
The analysis also did not account for differences between the groups before the intervention, for example, their baseline employment status (for employment outcomes) or criminal history (for recidivism outcomes).

The study was a randomized controlled trial. Data sources included a baseline information form (BIF), which collected demographic and background characteristics and students’ records from the City University of New York (CUNY), including students’ transcripts and CUNY assessment test data.
The study found that ASAP had significant impacts on full-time enrollment, credits attempted, and credits earned during the first, second, and third semesters following random assignment.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to ASAP, and not to other factors.","","CUNY, in conjunction with the Center for Economic Opportunity, developed ASAP in 2007. The program aimed to support community college students seeking associate’s degrees by providing enhanced services. The program was implemented in all six CUNY community colleges and included the following components: (1) a requirement to attend college full time; (2) block-scheduled classes with other ASAP students for the first year of the program; (3) participation in an ASAP seminar that covers goal-setting, study skills, and academic planning for at least two semesters of the program; (4) free use of textbooks during the semester; (5) comprehensive advising from an ASAP adviser with a small caseload of 60 to 80 students; (6) tutoring; (7) career services; (8) a tuition waiver that covered any gap between a student’s financial aid and tuition and fees; and (9) free monthly MetroCards. ASAP encouraged participants to complete their developmental education early and graduate within three years. Therefore, ASAP included only students in majors whose requirements could reasonably be completed in three years. To be eligible for the program and evaluation beginning in 2010, students had to meet the following criteria: (1) low-income New York City resident; (2) in need of developmental courses based on CUNY Assessment Tests; (3) new student or continuing student who completed at most one full-time, 12-credit semester; (4) be willing to attend college full-time; and (5) in an ASAP-eligible major.","The study was a randomized controlled trial, with 896 eligible students from three participating CUNY community colleges. Data for the analysis came from the BIF, which provided demographic and background characteristics, and CUNY students’ records, which provided transcript information from all colleges in the CUNY system as well as scores from CUNY assessment tests. Upon completing the BIF and consenting to participate in the study, eligible students were randomly assigned to the treatment group, which was offered the opportunity to participate in ASAP, or the control group, which could not participate in ASAP but could access standard community college services. Due to differences between the colleges’ academic calendars, the authors separated the participating colleges into two cohorts. The authors conducted random assignment during spring 2010 for Kingsborough Community College and LaGuardia Community College (cohort 1), and in fall 2010 for Borough of Manhattan Community College (cohort 2). This report compared outcomes for the treatment and control groups during the first and second semesters after random assignment for both cohorts. In addition, the authors reported outcomes for the third semester after random assignment for cohort 1. The authors estimated regression models comparing the outcomes of treatment and control group members, controlling for college and cohort.","The study found that, at the end of the first program semester, ASAP group members in both cohorts were 10.6 percentage points more likely to be enrolled in school full-time and 8.1 percentage points less likely to be enrolled part-time compared with the control group. Both of these findings were statistically significant.
Treatment group members attempted 2.2 more credits by the end of the first program semester than control group members. ASAP participants were also 14.7 percentage points more likely to have completed their developmental requirements at the end of the first semester relative to the control group. Both of these findings were statistically significant.
After two semesters, ASAP group members were 20.6 percentage points more likely to be enrolled as full-time students, and attempted 1.7 more college-level credits, compared with the control group. Both findings were statistically significant.
In the third program semester, the cohort 1 treatment group had significant increases in full-time enrollment, number of college-level credits attempted, and number of semesters enrolled, relative to the cohort 1 control group.","The study authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to progress toward degree completion. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness.

The authors used behavioral economic theory to explain barriers to successful policies related to unemployment insurance, job search assistance, and job training. They also proposed policy solutions to overcome these barriers.
For unemployment insurance, the authors recommended implementing wage loss insurance that subsidizes reemployment wages to counteract individuals’ tendencies to set high reservation wages when seeking employment, which slows their return to work. They also recommended providing small, immediate, and high frequency reminders and incentives to search for work.
To increase participation in job search assistance, the authors recommended policies that automatically put unemployed individuals into services and/or to make job search assistance more user-friendly and personalized. Similarly, to increase participation in job training programs, the authors recommended streamlining or simplifying training offerings and providing guidance to reduce the burden on the prospective users to select and start a program. Simplifying the decision-making process by creating a competitive training market could also be beneficial to prospective users.","","","","","","",""

Data were collected from a baseline survey and 12-month follow-up survey, the Ticket Research File (TRF), and the Master Earnings File (MEF). The authors estimated program impacts on measures of paid employment, educational attainment, and Social Security disability benefit receipt.
The study found that Youth Works had positive impacts on employment, earnings, and total income after one year of implementation. There were no impacts on educational attainment and Social Security disability benefit receipt.
The quality of causal evidence presented in the study is high for the education, employment, and SSA benefit receipt outcomes because they are based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial with low attrition. However, the quality of causal evidence is moderate for earnings and total income because sample attrition for these outcomes was high.","Absence of conflict of interest: This study was conducted by staff from Mathematica Policy Research, which administers CLEAR. Therefore, the review of this study was conducted by an independent consultant trained in applying the CLEAR causal evidence guidelines.","The West Virginia Youth Works program was one of six project sites evaluated using a randomized design as part of the larger SSA-sponsored YTD, which intended to help youth with disabilities become more self-sufficient and improve their employment outcomes.

All YTD participants were also eligible for waivers that (1) extended the student earned income exclusion to all YTD participants regardless of age, (2) increased the earned income exclusion to a $1 reduction in Supplemental Security Income benefit for every $4 earned above a base amount, and (3) delayed benefit cessation for YTD participants who were determined ineligible for benefits after a benefit review or age-18 SSI medical redetermination.","The study was a randomized controlled trial in which 455 youth were randomly assigned to the treatment group and 397 to the control group. Data were collected from baseline and 12-month follow-up surveys and SSA’s TRF and MEF. The TRF supplied data on benefit receipt status, benefit amounts paid, and disabling condition, whereas the MEF provided baseline earnings information. Regression-adjusted impacts were estimated for several outcomes, such as paid employment, earnings, educational attainment, monthly Social Security disability benefit receipt, and total income from earnings and benefits.","The study found that Youth Works had positive impacts on employment and earnings in the first 12 months of follow-up.

Although conclusions based on data from two relatively small projects located in a single state cannot fully settle the issue, results from linear regression models suggested that receiving higher dosages of benefits counseling services led to better employment outcomes.

To do this, the authors used a regression model to compare changes over time in firms randomly chosen to receive inspections to changes in uninspected firms.
The study found that the number of injuries and the cost of injuries declined after OSHA inspected a firm. In addition, the study found no evidence that the firms OSHA inspected had lower employment, sales, or credit ratings or were less likely to continue to operate than firms OSHA did not inspect.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is moderate because the study used a well-conducted nonexperimental design. This means we have confidence that the estimated effects are attributable at least in part to OSHA inspections. However, other factors not accounted for in the study could also have contributed to the estimated effects.","","The study examined the effect of a random OSHA inspection on firm-level measures of injury-related outcomes (the number of injuries and total cost of injuries) and firm performance (employment, payroll, sales, survival, and creditworthiness). Firms were designated as having been inspected if they had been randomly selected to have an OSHA inspection and such an inspection had been attempted.
Injury-related outcomes were measured by annual workers’ compensation claims and the dollar value of those claims. Firm performance was measured using sales, employment, payroll, an indicator for whether a firm disappeared from the databases (firm “death”) during the sample period, credit score, and Dun & Bradstreet’s Composite Credit Appraisal score.","The study analyzed the set of single-establishment firms operating in California from 1996 to 2006 in high-injury industries. Of these firms, some were randomly selected to receive an inspection. However, the authors did not know the set of firms from which the randomly selected firms was drawn, and therefore could not identify the firms that were considered for inspection but not randomly selected.
Instead, the authors created a matched comparison group of firms that had similar characteristics to the randomly inspected firms but had not themselves been inspected. To be considered a match, comparison firms had to be in the same industry and region of California as the randomly inspected firms, be classified as a single-establishment firm, have at least 10 employees, and not have been inspected in the two years preceding the match year.
The study sample consisted of 5,593 firm-year observations from 409 randomly inspected and 409 matched comparison firms, observed from 1996 to 2006. The authors used data on inspections from OSHA’s Management Information System, payroll and injuries from the Uniform Statistical Reporting Plan database (from the Workers’ Compensation Insurance Rating Board), and additional establishment data from Dun & Bradstreet’s compilation of credit ratings and the National Establishment Time-Series database.
The authors used a difference-in-differences model and controlled for year- and firm-level fixed-effects. This type of model compares changes over time in randomly inspected firms to changes over time in uninspected firms. The authors showed that pre-inspection trends in measures of the outcomes were similar for inspected and uninspected firms, demonstrating the validity of this approach.","The number of injuries decreased by an average of 9.5 percent after firms received a random OSHA inspection. The cost of injuries (in terms of worker’s compensation claims) also fell by 26 percent after the inspection.
 Firms’ performance, as measured by sales, payroll, employment, creditworthiness, and firm survival, did not change after receiving random OSHA inspections.","Although the firms inspected in this study were randomly selected for inspection, the authors did not know the set from which randomly inspected firms were selected and instead had to select a comparison group from the set of all uninspected firms. This might have included some firms that had initially been selected for inspection but were not actually inspected (inspectors had some discretion over conducting inspections of all randomly selected firms). Because the study groups were not formed randomly, the study should be considered a nonexperimental design.
Given the nonexperimental design, the authors provided ample evidence that the groups being compared in this study were similar before the random inspections were performed. In particular, the two groups of firms had similar values of the outcome variables in the period before the selected firms were inspected as well as similar changes in those values over that period. This gives us confidence that the estimated effects are attributable at least in part to the effect of random inspections.","",""

In 2009 and 2010, TSP instituted two major changes, a decrease in the waiting period for eligibility to receive employer matching contributions and automatic enrollment in a Government Securities Investment Fund (G Fund).
This study used an interrupted time series design to compare employees’ investment behaviors before and after the TSP design changes. It used data from the TSP record-keeping system and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
Across the TSP participants analyzed, participation in FERS increased by about 4 percentage points from 2009 to 2012, whereas the average deferral rate decreased slightly from the 2008 level. TSP’s design changes were not associated with how often employees monitored their FERS investments.

Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","","","The study found that FERS participation increased among all TSP participants from 84.7 percent in 2009 (after the economic downturn) to 88.6 percent in 2012.
The study found that the average contribution rate declined from 2008 to 2010, likely a result of automatic enrollment and the economic downturn. From 2010 to 2012, the deferral rate rose but did not reach the 2008 level.
The two lowest salary quintiles increased or maintained their deferral rates from 2008, whereas the other quintiles had lower average deferral rates in 2012 than in 2008. However, the results also suggested that automatic enrollment had weaker impacts on FERS participation rates for people in the lowest wealth quintiles.","The analysis excluded certain subgroups of TSP participants: employees without matching OPM records, members of the legislative and judicial branches, and part-time and intermittent workers. In addition, deferral rates were based on a comparison of total employee contributions to the annual salary rate for each year, because actual rates were not available in the data.
The interventions reviewed here were each implemented only once. This makes it difficult to conclude that the observed changes in enrollment rates were driven by the interventions themselves, instead of other concurrent changes (for example, changes in market conditions). Additionally, the study does not address the reasonable possibility that the interventions, and subsequent observed behaviors, occurred in response to existing economic trends.","",""

Inspections with penalties had no statistically significant relationship to injuries for workplaces with fewer than 20, or more than 250, employees.","In this study, the estimated differences between firms in the changes in injury rates may not be caused by inspections with penalties. The differences in injury rates could reflect underlying differences in safety levels or other factors between the firms being compared. Penalties are assessed when an inspection uncovers OSHA violations; therefore, the firms that received a penalty may have had more egregious safety violations that management would have addressed, even without the inspection and penalty. Similarly, firms that receive inspections are likely less safe, on average, than those in which no inspection was conducted, because some inspections are triggered by an employee complaint of a workplace hazard. In the absence of inspections, firms with more hazards and safety violations may have experienced different changes in injury rates as conditions deteriorated or because management took actions to address unsafe working conditions.","",""

The study also examined whether TGPs resulted in a greater number of non-STEM doctoral degrees, but that is not the focus of this review.
The authors analyzed data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System to estimate the impact of a university’s participation in one of seven TGPs during the 2003–2005 period, controlling for institutional characteristics.
The study found that TGPs were associated with a higher number of doctoral degrees awarded in STEM fields to women across all institutions.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to universities’ participation in TGPs. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Despite growing graduate enrollments of women and underrepresented candidates of color, STEM doctoral conferral rates for these students remain sluggish. In response, prestigious foundations and institutional associations launched several grants to fund TGPs. Competitive TGP grants challenge universities to make doctoral programs more inclusive and supportive, offering more well-rounded preparation to meet the real-world demands of contemporary careers in research, teaching, and service.","The authors examined the effectiveness of 7 well-known TGPs sponsored by prominent institutions among 246 doctoral degree–granting universities in the United States from 2003–2005. Of those, 117 did not participate in a TGP and 129 participated in at least one TGP. The TGPs studied included (from largest to smallest):
National Science Foundation’s Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program (87 institutions)
Council of Graduate Schools’ PhD Completion Project (43 institutions)
Council of Graduate Schools and Association of American Colleges & Universities’ Preparing Future Faculty (43 institutions)
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching’s Initiative on the Doctorate (42 institutions)
National Science Foundation’s ADVANCE (24 institutions)
Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation’s Responsive PhD (20 institutions)
National Institutes of Health’s Graduate Partnerships program (10 institutions)
The authors employed hierarchical ordinary least squares regression models to predict the 2003–2005 average annual number of STEM doctoral degrees, STEM doctoral degrees awarded to women, and STEM doctoral degrees awarded to underrepresented students of color. They controlled for institution-level differences in institutional control, average annual student enrollment, level of research activity, and proportion of doctoral degrees conferred in STEM disciplines. The authors also compared the relative effectiveness of the four largest TGPs.","The study found that TGPs were associated with a higher number of doctoral degrees awarded in STEM fields to women across all institutions; however, this association did not hold when looking only at STEM-dominant institutions.
When looking at the four largest TGPs, only IGERT was associated with a higher number of doctoral degrees awarded to women in STEM fields.","Although the study controlled for several important institutional-level variables, the authors acknowledged the possibility that other institutional characteristics that were not controlled for in the model could encourage both the adoption of TGPs and the award of more doctoral degrees to women. For instance, institutional leadership and culture could drive both the desire to adopt a TGP and higher rates of doctoral degree completion by women. In addition, even though CLEAR does not require explicit demonstrations of baseline equivalence, the study indicated that the groups being compared were quite dissimilar, leading to doubts about the extent to which including controls in the model could reduce the potential for bias.","",""

Impacts were measured six years after random assignment. Students in the Opening Doors learning communities took three linked courses during one semester and were provided with tutoring and case management services.
The study was a randomized controlled trial. Eligible students were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which was offered the opportunity to participate in one of the learning communities, or the control group, which was not allowed to enroll in a learning community. The primary data sources were a baseline survey on the background characteristics of students, students’ transcripts, and degree attainment information from the National Student Clearinghouse.
The study found no significant impacts on the total number of semesters enrolled, total credits earned, percentage of participants who earned a degree, percentage of participants who earned a bachelor’s degree or higher or an associate’s degree, or the percentage of participants who ever enrolled in a four-year institution.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects would be attributable to the Opening Doors learning communities, and not to other factors.","","At Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn, New York, the Opening Doors learning communities program involved enrolling small cohorts of students in three linked courses during one semester. These learning communities involved an English course, a college-level course required for a specific major, and a one-credit freshman orientation class. The freshman orientation class was a seminar designed to reinforce the learning objectives of the other two courses. Each learning community also had a case manager who offered academic guidance to students and a tutor who provided students with one-on-one tutoring. Learning community students were also provided with $150 textbook vouchers. This study focused on four cohorts of students who participated in the Opening Doors learning communities from 2003 to 2005 and examined their educational outcomes six years after random assignment.
To participate in the Opening Doors learning communities, students had to be first-time incoming freshman ages 17 to 34 planning to attend college full-time during the day, and be enrolled in either a developmental or college-level English course. During the 2003–2004 academic year, Kingsborough Community College also implemented a separate set of career-focused learning communities for four majors. Any student who had declared one of those four majors was not eligible to participate in the first year of this study of Opening Doors learning communities. After the first year, however, students in the four majors could participate in the study.","This study was a randomized controlled trial. Randomization occurred at the student level, separately for each cohort (fall 2003, spring 2004, fall 2004, and spring 2005). Eligible students who consented to participate in the study filled out a baseline data form. Then, the students were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which was offered the opportunity to enroll in a learning community, or the control group, which could not enroll in a learning community but could access existing college services. There were 1,534 students in the study with 769 in the treatment group and 765 in the control group.
The authors used data from the baseline data form, students’ transcripts, and the National Student Clearinghouse for outcomes related to progress toward degree completion and actual degree completion. The authors estimated program impacts using a linear regression model that included student-level baseline characteristics and cohort-level fixed effects as control variables. The main focus of this study was on students’ outcomes six years after random assignment.","The study found no significant differences between the treatment and control groups on the total number of semesters enrolled or the total number of credits earned six years after random assignment.
The study also found no significant differences between the treatment and control groups on the percentage of participants who earned a degree, the percentage of participants who earned a bachelor’s degree or higher or an associate’s degree, or the percentage of participants who ever enrolled in a four-year institution six years after random assignment.","Although all the basic features of the Opening Doors learning communities were implemented at Kingsborough Community College, the authors noted a few concerns with fidelity to the program model. First, although the program planned for classes to have about 25 students, the learning community courses were often underenrolled, with class sizes varying from 6 to 25 students and averaging 17 students. Second, the level of integration between courses and collaboration between faculty teaching the linked courses varied by learning community, which might have dampened the overall impact of the integrative component of the Opening Doors learning community model at Kingsborough.
This study examined the impact of a one-semester program six years after random assignment. Over the course of the long follow-up period, it is possible the program impacts might have faded.","",""

The study used regression models to compare changes in the claim rates and claim costs across years for firms that had a DOSH inspection or consultation with those that did not.
The study found that DOSH activities were associated with statistically significant reductions in workers’ compensation claim rates. The study also found reductions in claims’ costs in firms with DOSH activities, but this was not statistically significant.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this study is low. This means we do not have confidence that the effects estimated in this study are attributable to DOSH activities.","","The study examined the effect of having a DOSH inspection in a given year on the change in the compensation injury rate between the specified year and the subsequent year. The study also examined the effect of DOSH consultations, wherein firms volunteered to be visited and could have received feedback on the safety of their workplaces. In addition, the authors examined the relationship between each type of activity and the costs of workers’ compensation claims.","The study used a regression model to compare the difference in the injury rates and claims costs for the baseline year (year of inspection) and subsequent year for firms that received a DOSH inspection or consultation with those that received neither an inspection nor a consultation in the baseline year. Models included controls for outcomes in the two years before the baseline period, firm size, and whether an employer’s industry was classified as having fixed-location (for example, manufacturing) or variable-location worksites (for example, construction).
The authors used workers’ compensation data from the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries and DOSH activity data from the Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act Information Network. The resulting data set covered the period 1998 to 2008 and contained information on 86,314 state fund workers’ compensation account-year observations.","In both fixed- and variable-site industries and across all study years, employers that had DOSH enforcement inspections had greater decreases (3.1 to 4.3 percentage points) in compensable injury rates than employers with no DOSH activity; these differences were statistically significant.
DOSH consultation visits were associated with a statistically significant reduction in compensable injury rates for variable-site workplaces (8.5 percentage points) but had no statistically significant effect in fixed-site workplaces.
 ","In this study, the estimated differences in outcomes between firms being compared could reflect underlying differences in safety levels or other factors and not the effect of DOSH activities. For example, complaints of workplace hazards trigger many enforcement inspections. Therefore, the firms that received inspections could have had more underlying workplace hazards, on average, than firms that DOSH did not inspect. Similarly, firms that volunteered to undergo consultation visits likely differ from those that did not volunteer for those visits, even conditional on previous injury rates. For instance, firms with more attentive management might be more likely to both volunteer for consultation visits and mitigate workplace hazards even in the absence of the consultation. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the causal effect of the consultation visits or inspections using the approach in this study.","",""

Students in the learning communities took a developmental course that was linked to either a college-level course or a student success course, depending on the specific school, during one semester. One community college also provided students in the learning communities with tutoring and case management services.
The study pooled data from six randomized controlled trials, in which eligible students were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which was offered the opportunity to participate in the learning community program, or the control group, which could not participate in the learning community program. The primary data sources were a baseline survey on background characteristics and student transcripts.
The study found that the treatment group had significantly higher full-time registration rates and earned significantly more total cumulative credits during the program semester than the control group, but these differences were not significant in the two follow-up semesters. In addition, the study found no significant impacts on course enrollment rates or total cumulative credits attempted in the program semester or the two follow-up semesters.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the learning communities, and not to other factors.","","Although each school in this study implemented a different version of the learning community model, each version shared certain core elements. Each learning community was implemented over one semester and had small cohorts of students with linked courses, which included one developmental course in a target subject. At two of the colleges, the program’s target subject was developmental math, whereas the other four targeted a developmental reading, writing, or English course. A few of the colleges linked the math or reading course with another college-level content course; others linked the math or reading course with a college success or orientation course. Across the linked courses, instructors integrated instructional practices, grading mechanisms, and projects. Learning communities also included more hands-on faculty time and more extensive instructional and counseling supports for students. Five of the schools operated the learning communities over roughly the same time period. At three colleges, enrollment in the learning communities occurred from spring 2008 to fall 2009. One school operated the learning communities from fall 2007 to fall 2008, and another operated the program from fall 2007 to spring 2009. The sixth school implemented the program from fall 2003 to spring 2005.
Eligibility for participating in learning communities varied by school. All six schools targeted students in developmental English, reading or math courses. Most schools had additional age restrictions, and some limited the program to first-time college students, returning students, or transfer students.","This was a randomized controlled trial. Random assignment occurred at the student level, separately by campus and semester cohort. During the registration period of the semester, college staff identified and invited eligible students to participate in the program. Students interested in the program completed a baseline information form and consented to participate in the study. Then, students were randomized into either the treatment group, which was offered the opportunity to participate in a learning community, or the control group, which could not participate in the learning community but could access existing services on campus. The process began again in the next semester. The probability of being assigned to the treatment group varied across colleges and cohorts. Across the six colleges, there were 6,974 students in the study, with 3,983 in the treatment group and 2,991 in the control group.
Using data from students’ transcripts and the baseline information form, the authors estimated impacts of the learning communities by comparing the differences between the mean outcomes of students in the intervention condition and mean outcomes of students in the control condition. The main results were pooled across the six colleges and weighted to account for different random assignment ratios across cohorts. The authors provided impact estimates for the program semester and two follow-up semesters for each school.","The study found that there were no significant differences in course enrollment rates between the treatment and control group in the program semester or in the two follow-up semesters.
Treatment group members had a statistically significant 3 percentage point increase in full-time registration in the program semester compared with the control group, but the difference between the groups was not statistically significant in the two follow-up semesters.
Treatment group members earned significantly more cumulative total credits in the program semester than the control group, but there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the two follow-up semesters.","Impacts varied substantially by college; impacts were significantly higher at Kingsborough Community College, which offered the program with a rich set of instructional supports, than they were at other schools.
The study authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to persistence toward degree completion. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in this domain is likely to be overstated.","The Community College of Baltimore County in Maryland

A group of university employees were randomly assigned to one of four conditions:
Participants in the planning treatment group received general retirement savings information, including enrollment instructions for the university’s voluntary retirement plan.
Participants in the balance treatment group received all planning treatment materials plus personalized projections of retirement fund balances and access to an online customization tool.
Participants in the income treatment group received all planning and balance treatment materials plus a personalized projection of income during retirement.
Participants in the control group received no intervention and were in departments with only control group members.

The study analyzed retirement-fund contribution data from the university’s Office of Human Resources using fixed-effects regressions. The study also collected and analyzed additional survey data regarding financial literacy, tolerance for delayed gratification, tendency to procrastinate, and beliefs about saving.
Participants in the income treatment group contributed $85.42 more on average, annually, to their retirement savings accounts than did members of the control group. Both this group and those in the balance treatment group exhibited statistically significant increases in the probability of changing their contribution amounts of 1.2 and 1.4 percentage points, respectively.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is high. This means that we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the different levels of the intervention and not to other factors.","","","","Participants in the income treatment group contributed significantly more annually than the control group, with an average additional contribution of $85.42.
The balance and income treatment groups were 1.4 and 1.2 percentage points, respectively, more likely to change their contributions—that is, either enroll in the plan or modify their contribution levels, with both differences statistically significant at the 1 percent level.
Despite apparent gains in retirement savings contributions among the treatment groups, the authors did not reject the joint hypothesis that all three treatments had no effect on contribution amounts. However, all three treatments, taken together, had a statistically significant effect on participants’ propensity to change their contribution levels.
Based on responses to the follow-up survey, participants in the income treatment group were 12 percent more likely to have determined how much they need to save for retirement. Treatment groups did not differ in their reported understanding of how savings today affect retirement income.","Contribution rate analyses relied on administrative data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with low attrition; however, response rates to the follow-up survey were so low that these outcomes were derived from an RCT with high attrition. The authors established that individual characteristics, such as income and age, do not predict survey response differently in the treatment and comparison groups. Additionally, there is little reason to believe that the composition of survey respondents differed systematically across treatment groups. Thus, attrition likely did not lead to large biases in the survey data analyses.
The authors note that the participants in their study might be more educated and have a higher level of financial literacy compared with the average individual. This suggests that the results of this study might not apply to broader populations of workers.
The study authors estimated multiple related impacts for both changes in contributions and indicators suggesting any change in contributions. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance. Although the authors correct for multiple comparisons within a single model by testing the joint hypothesis that all three treatment effects—the effects of the planning, balance, and income conditions—are equal to zero, this adjustment does not correct for the large number of models presented in the study. Thus, some of both the joint and individual hypothesis tests are likely to exceed the statistical significance threshold by chance alone.","",""

The program targeted high school juniors, seniors, and recent exiters with severe emotional disturbances (schizophrenia, personality, mood, conduct, anxiety, attention deficit, attention deficit hyperactivity, and depression disorders) or other significant mental illness. All youth were currently receiving or considered at high risk of eventually receiving disability benefits. All YTD participants were also eligible for waivers that (1) extended the student earned income exclusion to all YTD participants regardless of age, (2) increased the earned income exclusion to a $1 reduction in Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit for every $4 earned above a base amount, and (3) delayed benefit cessation for YTD participants who were determined ineligible for benefits after a benefit review or age-18 SSI medical redetermination.","The study was a randomized controlled trial that assigned 422 youth to the treatment group and 383 to the control group.

Related reports examined impacts of the program at 10 sites measured at 9, 21, and 36 months.
The authors used several types of data to determine the program’s costs and benefits. For costs, the data included program budgets and the March 2010 Current Population Survey. For benefits, the main data source was the impact estimates from the 36-month follow-up and data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979 cohort (NLSY79).
The authors calculated the operating and opportunity costs of the program per admitted cadet and compared this to the lifetime benefits of being admitted to the program, including increased earnings, decreased dependence on social welfare, and decreased criminal activity.
The study found that net benefits of the program, from the perspective of society as a whole, were $25,549 per admittee, a return on investment of 166 percent. The government incurred negative net benefits, largely due to covering the bulk of the operating costs, and the participants had substantial, positive net benefits.","","The National Guard Youth ChalleNGe program began in the early 1990s with a mission to target at-risk youth and equip them with the skills and training to have successful adult lives. To be eligible, youth had to be 16 to 18 years of age, have dropped out of or been expelled from school, be unemployed, not be drug users, and not be heavily involved in the criminal justice system.
The 17-month program consists of a two-week Pre-Challenge phase, a 20-week Residential phase, and a one-year Post-Residential phase. Participants live in barracks-style housing (sometimes on a military base) in a very disciplined environment during the first two phases. They wear their hair short, are referred to as cadets, and wear military uniforms. In the Pre-Challenge phase, participants are oriented to the program’s rules and begin physical training. During the Residential phase, they participate in a number of different activities addressing eight core pillars: leadership/followership, responsible citizenship, service to community, life-coping skills, physical fitness, health and hygiene, job skills, and academic excellence. Cadets spend most of their time in an educational component that is usually geared toward passing the General Educational Development (GED) test. During the Post-Residential phase of the program, after participants are placed in employment, education, or military service, they receive structured mentoring. The federal government covers 75 percent of program costs and state governments fund the other 25 percent.","This study included the same set of 10 program sites in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Texas, and Wisconsin that had been included in the random assignment evaluation (see CLEAR profile of Millenky et al. 20111). The authors collected information on program budgets from each site to determine the average operating costs per ChalleNGe admittee. In addition to the operating cost, the authors computed the opportunity cost of applying to the program and serving as a volunteer mentor or mentee during the Post-Residential phase of the program using data from the March 2010 Current Population Survey.
On the benefit side, the authors used data from the NLSY79 to estimate a model of the returns to various levels of education over the lifetime. They then multiplied these values by the impact estimates to arrive at a present value of the benefit ChalleNGe admittees could expect as a result of the program. They performed similar exercises to calculate the average value of reduced social welfare dependence and criminal activity.","The operating cost per ChalleNGe admittee was $11,633 (in 2010 dollars) on average across participating sites.
On the cost side, there were additional opportunity costs and deadweight losses of taxation resulting in a total cost to society per admittee of $15,436. On the benefits side, factoring in the increased lifetime earnings, decreased social welfare dependency and criminal activity, increased service to the community, and efficiency losses attributable to taxation, the total benefits to society were $40,985 per admittee.
Thus, the net benefits to society were $25,549 per admittee, a return on investment of 166 percent. When the net benefits to society were broken into net benefits to the government and to the participants, the analysis found that the government incurred negative net benefits, largely due to covering the bulk of the operating costs, and the participants had substantial, positive net benefits.","As noted by the study authors, the calculations of costs and benefits are sensitive to several assumptions, including those around the discount rate and those used to develop the model of returns from education. The authors performed numerous sensitivity analyses to test how variations in the assumptions affected the findings and found that, in general, the net benefits to society were still positive.
The authors also noted that the analysis focused on labor market outcomes and not other nonpecuniary factors such as benefits to health, thus potentially understating the benefits to those outcomes. In addition, they estimated the cost per admittee, rather than attendee, because the impact estimates were based on an analysis of all admittees, not only those who attended the program. This likely understates the impacts of the program on those who actually attended it and, consequently, the net benefits they realized.","","1Millenky, M., Bloom, D., Muller-Ravett, S., & Broadus, J.

The study was a randomized controlled trial. Of some 33,000 first-time UI claimants eligible for the study, about 5,100 were randomly assigned to the treatment group, which had to take part in REA and reemployment services (RES) to retain UI eligibility, and the rest were randomly assigned to the control group, which was not required to participate in such services. The authors compared state administrative records on UI payments and covered employment of the two groups to estimate the program’s effectiveness.
The study found that, in the first six calendar quarters following the initial claim, REA services substantially reduced the average duration and amount of UI benefits receipt, increased employment rates, and increased earnings.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is high because it is based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the REA services, and not other factors.","","Since its inception in 2005, 40 states have implemented the REA initiative to encourage rapid reemployment of UI claimants through a combination of in-person eligibility reviews and employment-focused case management. In the Nevada version of REA, active treatment units were required to receive not only REA services but also RES, which were provided by the same staff. REA services included an individual assessment, orientation to the One-Stop Career Center (now known as American Job Center), provision of labor market information, a workforce service workshop, and development of an individual reemployment plan. RES services included job search and resume assistance, job matching against state and federal position databases, and provision of information regarding job training options.
To be eligible for the program, Nevada residents had to be filing first-time UI claims, had received at least one week of benefits under the new claim, had no scheduled return to a previous employer, were not concurrently participating in other training programs, had no exclusive union hiring hall agreements, and were not part of the Worker Profiling and Reemployment Services program.","Following an earlier cross-state report, which found that the Nevada REA program was particularly successful in reducing UI benefits receipt in the 12 to18 months after random assignment, the Department of Labor commissioned this follow-up study to estimate longer-term impacts on UI receipt over 21 to 26 months, as well as employment outcomes in the 18 months after random assignment. From July to December 2009, 32,751 first-time UI claimants were determined to be eligible for the program; of these, 5,157 were randomly assigned to the treatment group, which was required to receive REA and RES services. The remaining eligible claimants were assigned to the control group, which was not required to receive REA or RES but had to continue the usual requirements for UI claimants, such as weekly claims filing, conducting an independent job search, and being subject to random quality assurance evaluation. If desired, the control group members could seek out RES on their own.
Administrative data on UI benefits receipt, employment, and earnings were collected for six quarters following enrollment in the program for each claimant. For UI benefits receipt, the authors examined regular UI and Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC), which was also in effect during the period of study. The authors used a regression model to estimate the impacts of the REA program on various UI benefits receipt outcomes, employment, and earnings. The regression models controlled for gender, race, education, age, occupation group, citizenship, veterans’ status, disability status, maximum UI benefits amount, weeks of UI eligibility, the One-Stop Career Center (now American Job Center) at which the claimant filed his or her claim, the date of the original claim, and prior wage earnings.","The study found the following statistically significant impacts:
REA group members were about 10 percent less likely to exhaust regular UI benefits and 9 percent less likely to receive EUC benefits, compared to the control group.
On average, REA group members received 3.13 fewer weeks of regular UI and EUC than the control group.
REA group members received $873 less in total UI benefits—$536 less in regular UI payments and $337 less in EUC payments—than control group members.
REA group members were significantly more likely to be employed (have any wage earnings) in each of the six follow-up quarters than the control group, ranging from 8.1 percent more likely in the second quarter after their claims to 4.3 percent more likely in the sixth quarter after their claims.
In total, the average REA group member earned $2,611 more across the first six post-filing quarters than did the average control group member.","During the period of this study, the average annual state unemployment rate reached 13.9 percent, a 25-year record high in the state and the second highest in the nation. This exceptionally high unemployment rate triggered eligibility for weeks of benefits in addition to those available through the regular UI program. It is possible that these additional weeks of available benefits gave the program more opportunities to make an impact on the duration of UI benefits receipt, and that such impacts would not be observed during a time of lower unemployment.
This study examines the effect of the combination of REA and RES and thus does not reflect the efficacy of REA in isolation (although the control group was still eligible to receive RES).","",""

Therefore, the review of this study was conducted by an independent consultant trained in applying the CLEAR causal evidence guidelines.","BHBF in Miami-Dade County, Florida, was one of six project sites using a randomized design as part of the larger SSA-sponsored YTD, which intended to help youth with disabilities become more economically self-sufficient and improve their employment outcomes. Each site varied in terms of services provided and targeted participants. From April 2008 to March 2012, ServiceSource, a nonprofit organization focused on people with disabilities, offered person-centered case management services to young SSA recipients (ages 16 to 22) with severe disabilities. BHBF included personalized employment services and benefits counseling, financial literacy training, access to individual development accounts, and case management services focused on reducing barriers to employment. Among those enrolled in the study, 84 percent received these services, amounting to 29 hours of services per person, on average.
All YTD participants were also eligible for waivers that (1) extended the student earned income exclusion to all YTD participants regardless of age, (2) increased the earned income exclusion to a $1 reduction in Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit for every $4 earned above a base amount, and (3) delayed benefit cessation for YTD participants who were determined ineligible for benefits after a benefit review or age-18 SSI medical redetermination.","The study was a randomized controlled trial that randomly assigned 460 youth to the treatment group and 399 youth to the control group. Data were collected from baseline and 12-month follow-up surveys and SSA’s TRF and MEF. The TRF supplied data on benefit receipt status, benefit amounts paid, and disabling condition, whereas the MEF provided baseline earnings information. Regression-adjusted impacts were estimated for several outcomes, such as paid employment, earnings, educational attainment, monthly Social Security disability benefit receipt, and income from earnings and benefits.","The study found that BHBF had statistically significant impacts on employment and Social Security disability benefit receipt. Treatment group members experienced a 9.4 percentage point increase in employment rates and collected $312 more in Social Security disability benefits than the control group.
BHBF had no statistically significant impacts on earnings, education (high school enrollment/graduation), or total income.","Only 84 percent of youth assigned to the treatment group actually enrolled in BHBF during the study period.

The author used a survey to compare students’ attitudes about science before and after participating in InSTEP.
The author found that among the female 8th-grade students who chose to enroll in InSTEP, interest in science increased, gender stereotypes about science and scientists were undermined, and overall attitudes toward science improved by the end of the program. There were no significant differences in students’ anxiety about taking science courses.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to InSTEP; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The author developed InSTEP to increase female middle school students’ interest and confidence in studying science. The program consisted of participation in a week-long, half-day program at an urban university during participants’ summer vacations. Female students entering 8th grade were eligible to participate and had to be recommended to the program by a teacher on the basis of their interest in science.
Program time was spent in classroom and laboratory instruction using an inquiry-based curriculum that used environmental science topics and technology to engage students in science. The curriculum focused on air and water quality, human health, and alternative energy, and included information about and assignments on prominent female scientists. The program also integrated technology—including pH meters, thermometers, and Google Earth—into instruction.","The study was conducted at a large urban university in the Midwest. The author used data from surveys administered on the first and last days of the program to measure changes in participants’ interest and confidence in studying science. Based on responses to an author-designed attitude survey by the 35 students enrolled in the program, the author constructed indices gauging students’ level of comfort discussing science or participating in science class, their beliefs about women’s role and ability in science, and their interest in science and careers in science. The author also constructed an overall index summing these components. Impacts were calculated using paired t-tests between the baseline and post-test scores.","The study found that, among the 35 female 8th-grade students who chose to enroll in InSTEP, interest in science increased, gender stereotypes about science and scientists weakened, and attitudes towards science improved by the end of the program compared with the period before program enrollment. All of these findings were statistically significant.
The study found no statistically significant relationships between the program and students’ anxiety about science.","The author compared the outcomes of participants measured before and after they participated in InSTEP; there was no comparison group that did not participate in the program and could represent what might have occurred had the girls who chose to participate in InSTEP not enrolled in the program. For study designs of this type, CLEAR’s guidelines require that authors observe outcomes for multiple periods before an intervention to rule out the possibility that participants had increasing or decreasing trends in the outcomes examined before enrollment in the program. That is, if participants who had increasing interest or confidence in science tended to enroll in the program, we would anticipate further increases over time, even if they did not participate in the program. Without knowing the trends before program enrollment, we cannot rule this out.","",""

The study found statistically significant reductions in weeks of UI benefits receipt, total amount of UI benefits received, and the probability of benefits exhaustion for the REA treatment group. In addition, participants in REA had a statistically significantly higher probability of employment and earnings over the four follow-up quarters.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it is based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial.

Implementation of REA in Florida began in 2005, when 6 of the 24 workforce investment regions in the state used the program. In 2009, Florida expanded the program to 18 regions.
Under Florida’s REA initiative, UI claimants were required to receive reemployment services to maintain their UI eligibility. The services included an orientation to the services available at the local One-Stop Career Center (now known as American Job Center), an individual assessment, provision of local labor market information, creating an employment development plan, reviews of UI eligibility, and referrals to job services. To be eligible for the initiative, UI claimants had to have received one week of UI benefits under a new claim, not be scheduled return to work within six weeks of their claim, be a resident of Florida, not be involved in a union hiring hall, and not be active in a training program through the state’s Agency for Workforce Innovation or a Workforce Investment Act (WIA) program.","This study evaluated the effectiveness of the REA initiative in Florida from August 2009 to December 2009. Eligible UI claimants were randomly assigned to either a treatment group, which was required to attend REA services to retain UI eligibility; a second treatment group, which received the Priority Reemployment Program (PREP); or a control group, which was not offered either services but continued to file weekly claims, conduct independent job search, and be subject to random quality assurance evaluations, as required of all UI claimants. The findings for the PREP treatment group were not presented in the study and are not considered in this review.
The authors analyzed administrative data on UI benefits receipt and wages from enrollment in the program until December 2010 (four quarters of data for each claimant).

The authors also conducted analyses specific to the prestigious R01 award—the only award not intended for a specific career stage—including a longitudinal analysis of researchers transitioning to R01 awards or applying for renewal of R01 awards.
Overall, women tended to be as likely as men to receive NIH research and training awards in 2008, and applied for and received similar award amounts. In the R01 program, women had a similar success rate as men but a lower funding rate, which seemed to be caused by a lower rate of award among experienced applicants submitting proposals for award renewal. The longitudinal analysis confirmed that women were less likely than men to apply and receive funding for new or renewal R01 awards.

The authors used data from the 2009 U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey to examine how educational attainment, wages, and participation in STEM occupations differed by gender. Regression analyses that controlled for factors such as age, educational attainment, and region, were used to compare differences in STEM earnings and wage gaps.
The authors found that women continued to be underrepresented in STEM degrees and jobs, but there were reasons to encourage women to pursue STEM: the gap in STEM jobs between women and men decreased as educational attainment increased; there was a 7 percent smaller gender gap in hourly earnings for STEM jobs over non-STEM jobs (14 percent smaller in engineering jobs); women held a disproportionally small number of STEM degrees compared with men; and 14 percent fewer women than men with STEM undergraduate degrees ended up in STEM jobs.","","","","","","",""

This study was a randomized controlled trial that compared the course passage rates, registration rates, and number of credits earned for the treatment and control groups during the program semester and one (Houston) or two (Queensborough) post-program semesters. The primary data source was transcript data from the colleges.
The study found that at Queensborough, learning community students were significantly more likely than control group students to pass developmental math in the program semester and the second math class in their sequence during the next semester. At Houston, students in the treatment group were significantly more likely than control group students to pass any developmental math course in the program or first post-program semester. 
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Learning Communities Demonstration at Queensborough Community College and at Houston Community College, and not to other factors.","","The National Center for Postsecondary Research Learning Communities Demonstration was implemented in six community colleges across the United States from 2007 to 2009. It was designed to test whether learning communities were effective at improving academic performance among community college students in need of developmental courses. This study reported findings from the Learning Communities Demonstration at Queensborough Community College in Queens, New York, and at Houston Community College in Houston, Texas.
At Queensborough Community College, first-time students who placed into developmental math were eligible to participate in the study. Returning students who had failed developmental math or transfer students with fewer than 15 credits were also eligible. In the first semester of the demonstration, the learning communities consisted of a developmental math course linked with a developmental or college-level English course. In the subsequent semesters, developmental math was linked with a college-level course, allowing students to earn college credits while in the learning community. Four cohorts of students participated in the study: students who entered in fall 2007, spring 2008, fall 2008, and spring 2009.
At Houston Community College, first-year students who placed into the lowest level of developmental math were eligible to participate in the study. The Houston learning communities linked developmental math to a college- and career-planning course. Students in the learning communities enrolled in these two courses in one of four cohorts: spring 2008, fall 2008, spring 2009, and fall 2009. At both colleges, faculty teaching courses in the same learning community were encouraged to collaborate and integrate curriculum across the two courses.","At each college, students who were randomly assigned to the treatment group were offered the opportunity to enroll in one of the learning communities offered by the college. Control group students were informed that they were required to take developmental math courses as a prerequisite for college-level math, but they were not mandated to do so in the program semester. At Houston, any student who placed into a developmental course was required to take the college and career planning course; however, control students who enrolled in both developmental math and the student success course did not take these courses together with a specific cohort of students, as did the students in the learning communities group. The authors used transcript data provided by the colleges to measure completion of developmental and college-level math, semester registration rates, and the number of credits attempted and earned by students. Students’ baseline characteristics were obtained from a baseline information form completed by students at the time of intake. The authors estimated regression models comparing the outcomes of treatment and control group members during the program semester up to two semesters following the program, controlling for cohort and pre-algebra placement test scores and using weights to account for different random assignment ratios.","At Queensborough, the study found that students eligible to participate in a learning community were 11.7 percentage points more likely to pass developmental math in the program semester and 5.3 percentage points more likely to pass the second math course in their sequence in the next semester.
At Houston, students in the treatment group were 9.8 percentage points more likely to pass any developmental math course in the program or first post-program semester.","The authors conducted intent-to-treat analyses; however, only 71 percent of students randomly assigned to the treatment group at Houston Community College actually enrolled in a learning community during the program semester. At Queensborough, 85.2 percent of students assigned to a learning community actually did so. In addition, the authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to progress toward degree completion. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","",""

The authors used program implementation and outcome data obtained from seven participating colleges and universities to compare the number of female engineering faculty before and after institutions participated in the intervention.
The study found no statistically significant relationships between participation in the ADVANCE-IT program and the number of female assistant professors at those institutions.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is low because the authors conducted no tests of statistical significance and did not observe outcomes for multiple periods before the intervention. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects would have been attributable to the ADVANCE-IT program; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Since 2001, the NSF has invested more than $130 million in support of ADVANCE programs nationwide. ADVANCE programs aim to increase the participation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers. The ADVANCE-IT program, in particular, consists of five-year, institution-wide programs that aim to transform recruitment policies and practices, as well as the climates and cultures, of colleges and universities to advance women in STEM positions.","The authors compared the number of female faculty at the assistant professor rank in colleges of engineering before and after the ADVANCE-IT grant period to measure the impacts of targeted recruitment practices developed under the grant. Specifically, the study focused on changes in the number of full-time, tenure-track assistant professors from the start to the end of the grant period (2001–2006) and through the three years following the grant period (2006–2009). Associate and full professor ranks were excluded on the basis that any increase in senior female faculty was likely driven by promotions rather than recruitment. The study evaluated seven first-round recipients of ADVANCE-IT grants that offered engineering degrees from 2001 to 2009: Georgia Institute of Technology; New Mexico State University; University of California, Irvine; University of Colorado at Boulder; University of Michigan, Ann Arbor; University of Washington; and University of Wisconsin, Madison.
In addition to examining the net gain or loss of female faculty during the study period, the authors analyzed each institution’s recruitment practices and programs to identify similarities and differences in efforts among those with larger or smaller absolute gains in the number of female faculty. Data on female full-time, tenure-track engineering faculty at the assistant professor rank were obtained from the Profiles of Engineering and Engineering Technology Colleges published by the American Society for Engineering Education. Information on ADVANCE-related recruitment programs was obtained through grant proposals and final reports submitted by the institutions to the NSF and through the ADVANCE portal website.","The study found no statistically significant relationships between participation in the ADVANCE-IT program and the number of female assistant professors at those institutions.","The authors compared the outcomes of participating institutions measured before and after they participated in the ADVANCE-IT program. CLEAR’s guidelines require that the authors observe outcomes for multiple periods before the intervention to rule out the possibility that participating institutions had increasing or decreasing trends in the outcomes examined before enrollment in the program. That is, if institutions that had increasing numbers of female assistant professors tended to enroll in the program, we would anticipate further increases over time, even if they did not participate in the program. Without knowing the trends before program enrollment, we cannot rule this out.
Further, the authors did not conduct any tests of statistical significance to demonstrate that observed changes in the number of female assistant professors were meaningful and not due to chance. Lastly, none of the analyses controlled for institution-level characteristics such as average age and demographic composition, as required by CLEAR.","","1National Science Foundation. “ADVANCE at a Glance.” Available at http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/advance/."

The study randomly assigned 18,156 eligible claimants to either the treatment group, which was eligible for REA services, or the control group, which was not offered REA services. Within the treatment group, claimants were randomly assigned either to receive a letter requiring them to enter work search activities into an online system, or to receive both the letter and an in-person interview. Data for the analysis comes from UI administrative records.
The study found statistically significant reductions in weeks of UI benefits receipt, total amount of UI benefits received, total number of weeks receiving UI benefits, and the probability of benefits exhaustion for the treatment group.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it is based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the REA initiative, and not to other factors.","","Since its inception in 2005, 40 states have implemented the REA initiative to encourage rapid reemployment of UI claimants through a combination of in-person eligibility reviews and employment-focused case management. As part of the initiative in Idaho, UI claimants were required to submit their job search activities into an online database so program staff could track and monitor these activities. A portion of those offered REA services also participated in an in-person reemployment interview.
To be eligible for REA, claimants had to have received one week of benefits under a new UI claim, have filed for at least four weeks of benefits, not be due to exhaust claim within four weeks, not previously have been selected for REA or participated in other reemployment services, and not be residually attached to an employer.","From July to December 2009, 18,156 eligible UI claimants were randomly assigned to either a treatment group, which was offered services through the REA initiative, or a control group, which was not offered REA services. Those in the treatment group were required to fill in an online questionnaire. Then, those who completed the questionnaire were randomly assigned to receive either an online letter explaining REA (75 percent) or both the online letter and an in-person REA interview (25 percent). The authors analyzed all treatment group members together, regardless of whether they participated in the REA interview.
The authors analyzed administrative data on UI benefits receipt from enrollment until December 2010 (four quarters of data for each claimant). For UI benefits receipt, the authors examined regular UI and Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC), which was also in effect during the period of study. The authors used a regression model to estimate the impacts of the REA program on various UI benefits receipt outcomes. The regression models controlled for gender, race, ethnicity, education, age, occupation group, citizenship, veterans’ status, disability status, maximum UI benefits amount, number of weeks eligible for UI, prior wages, the One-Stop Career Center (now American Job Center) in which the claimant filed his or her claim, and the date of the claim.","The study found the following statistically significant impacts:
REA group members had a lower probability of exhausting their regular UI benefits than the control group (3.2 percentage points).
REA group members were 3.1 percentage points less likely to receive EUC than the control group.
On average, REA group members spent fewer weeks on UI, with an average reduction of 1.14 weeks on any form of UI, than the control group. Treatment group members reduced their time on regular UI by 0.45 weeks and on EUC by 0.7 weeks.
On average, REA participants received $262 less in total UI benefits—$97 less in regular UI and $165 less in EUC—than the control group.","All claimants randomized to the REA group, whether they ultimately received services or not, are considered treated units in all analyses. Thus, the analyses include the 20 percent of those assigned to the treatment group who did not complete the online questionnaire and thus had a stop placed on their UI claims. Of the remaining 80 percent, the analysis included those offered both the REA letter and the REA interview, and those offered only the REA letter.","",""

The authors used program implementation and outcome data obtained from 19 participating colleges and universities to examine program initiatives, actions, and outcomes of ADVANCE-IT institutions. The analysis of interest in this review compared the changes in proportions of female STEM faculty in institutions that were implementing ADVANCE-IT programs to national reference groups over the course of the program period, by faculty rank and by type of institution.
The study found that the ADVANCE-IT program was effective in increasing the number of female STEM faculty at all ranks in four-year colleges and research universities.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is low. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the ADVANCE-IT program. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Since 2001, NSF has invested more than $130 million in support of ADVANCE programs nationwide. ADVANCE programs aim to increase the participation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers. The ADVANCE-IT program, in particular, consists of five-year, institution-wide programs that aim to transform practices, policies, climate, and culture of colleges and universities to advance women in STEM positions.","The authors compared the growth in the proportion of female STEM faculty in institutions implementing ADVANCE-IT programs to that of a national reference group. Separate analyses were conducted by rank (assistant, associate, or full professor) and by type of institution (four-year college or research university). The study evaluated 19 first- and second-round recipients of ADVANCE-IT grants that had either completed or were close to completing their projects at the time of the evaluation. Cohort 1 included 7 institutions that began their projects in the 2001–2002 academic year and completed them by 2007. Cohort 2 included 10 institutions that began their projects in the 2003–2004 academic year and completed them by 2008. The sample contained 17 public and two private universities, including 11 very high research activity universities, 6 high research activity universities, one master’s college, and one baccalaureate college. Although the proportion of female STEM faculty varied across institutions, most institutions had no more than 21 percent during the period studied.
The national reference groups to which the authors compared ADVANCE-IT institutions were created using national survey data. Specifically, the authors compiled summary data from the 2001, 2003, and 2006 Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR). The SDR is a longitudinal survey conducted every two years on recipients of doctorates from U.S. institutions, with new recipients of doctorates added with each wave. For the purposes of this study, the reference group sample was limited to those who met the following criteria: their principal employer was an educational institution; they worked at a four-year college or university; their faculty rank was assistant, associate, or full professor; and their doctorate degree was in a STEM field.","The study found that the ADVANCE-IT programs increased female representation among STEM faculty, but gains were generally equal to, or only marginally greater than, those experienced by the national reference group.","The authors compared the annual percentage of STEM faculty who were female in institutions implementing ADVANCE-IT programs with similar percentages observed in a national reference group. They did not perform a statistical analysis or provide information suggesting that the groups being compared were experiencing similar levels or trends in the percentage of STEM faculty who were female before the institutions implemented ADVANCE-IT. Therefore, differences between women’s STEM representation in ADVANCE-IT institutions and the reference group might represent underlying differences between these groups, and not the effect of the ADVANCE-IT program.","",""

Data came from a compilation of multiple administrative data sources containing information on all DI and adult SSI disability recipients with at least one month in current pay status from 1996 onward, created for the Ticket to Work (TTW) evaluation.

The authors randomly assigned eligible applicants to either be invited to participate in the program immediately (treatment group) or gain entry after 10 months (control group). They compared the outcomes of treatment and control group members for approximately two years after random assignment.
The authors reported many statistically significant and positive impacts of the program in the second year after random assignment. These included impacts on annual earnings and hourly wages.
The quality of causal evidence is low because the randomized controlled trial had high attrition and the study did not show that the groups being compared were equivalent prior to the program. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to Year Up. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Year Up is a nonprofit organization headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. It was founded by a former software entrepreneur with the goal of providing a year of training and work experience to urban young adults. Participants in the Year Up program must be low-income and ages 18 to 24. A chief feature of the program model is six months of technical skills training in information technology and investment operations fields followed by a six-month internship with a top company in the region. The program also includes classes in business writing, communication, and professional skills training. Participants receive a weekly stipend and the support of social workers and mentors throughout the program.","In summer 2007, eligible Year Up applicants were randomly assigned to either be invited to participate in the program immediately (treatment group) or be placed on a waiting list to gain entry to the program after 10 months (control group). In total, 135 applicants were assigned to the treatment group and 60 to the control group. A follow-up survey was administered to both groups to capture post-program earnings and employment outcomes; the last survey was administered 24 to 30 months after random assignment.","During the first year after random assignment, the Year Up group’s earnings lagged those of control group members because most members of the Year Up group were participating in program-related activities. However, by two years after random assignment, Year Up participants were earning more than control group members by a statistically significant margin ($15,082 versus $11,621).
During the second year after random assignment, Year Up and control group members had similar levels of employment, but the Year Up group held higher-paying jobs, on average, than the control group ($12.58 per hour versus $10.32 per hour). 
The two groups were equally likely to be attending college two years after random assignment.","Although this study was based on a randomized controlled trial, which can provide the highest possible causal evidence if well-implemented, the trial suffered from high differential attrition across the study groups. In other words, outcomes were available for a larger proportion of Year Up members than control group members. This could bias the estimated effects of the program if characteristics of the control group are systematically related to responding to the follow-up survey. Therefore, this study cannot receive a high causal evidence rating.
In addition, the study did not demonstrate that the groups being compared were equivalent at the time of program application, nor was it clear from the study whether the authors included controls for baseline characteristics in their analysis approach. Attempts to reach the authors to clarify these issues were unsuccessful. Therefore, this study cannot receive a moderate causal evidence rating in the absence of additional information from the authors.","Year Up sites in three cities participated in the evaluation:

It also found a statistically significant relationship between the program and a reduction in child labor for boys aged 15-16 in 2003 but did not find a significant relationship between the program for girls or for any other age groups of boys.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high for short-term outcomes (18 months) because they are based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial but low for longer-term outcomes (five-and-a-half years) because the authors did not account for the outcomes of schooling and work at baseline.","Absence of conflict of interest.","The PROGRESA program started in Mexican rural areas in 1997 and was modified and renamed Oportunidades in 2000. It has gradually expanded to urban areas. The program provides monthly conditional cash transfers to five million families. The cash transfer is conditional upon child school attendance and health clinic visits for family members. The amount of the cash transfer varies by gender and increases with the grade of the child. However, if a child repeats a grade twice, he or she will permanently lose the cash transfer.","The study used survey data from a randomized controlled trial. The original study randomly assigned 320 communities to the treatment group and 186 communities to the control group. After 18 months, the control group also began to receive the treatment (cash benefits).
In this study, authors used the 1997 baseline Survey of Household Socio-Economic Conditions and linked it with data from the 2003 rural Evaluation Survey of PROGRESA/Oportunidades. This linkage provided longitudinal data for children who were 9 to 15 in 1997 and 15 to 21 in 2003. The authors had complete data for 8,894 children in the treatment group and 5,591 children in the control group.
To test the longer-term impact of the PROGRESA/Oportunidades program on schooling and work, the authors used propensity score matching to create a comparable group of non-participating households from 2003 data. The non-participating households had similar household and community characteristics as the participating households. This new comparison group comprised households from 152 communities that had not been involved in the program in 2003.","Employment/Child labor
The study found that 18 months of program exposure significantly reduced participation in work by 4.1 percent for boys but had no significant effect for girls.
The study found a statistically significant relationship between the program and a reduction in child labor for boys aged 15-16 in 2003 but not for girls or any other age group of boys.
Education (School participation/enrollment)
The study found that 18 months of program exposure significantly increased the school grade completed by 2.4 percent for boys and 2.7 percent for girls.
The study found a statistically significant relationship between the program and increased school grade completion five-and-a-half years post-implementation for all groups with the exception of girls aged 17-19.","The authors created a matched group of non-participating households to compare to PROGRESA/Oportunidades participating-households. However, the authors did not account for the outcomes at baseline, such as previous school attendance or child labor. Preexisting differences between the groups—and not the program/intervention— could explain the observed differences in outcomes. Also, the education outcomes, but not the work outcomes, were the same for the original treatment and control groups at baseline.","",""

These files contained extensive information on the more than 20 million Disability Insurance or Supplemental Security Income recipients who received a benefit in at least one month from January 1996 through December 2007. They included data on benefits, earnings, and enrollment in vocational rehabilitation services for 100 percent of the Disability Insurance population, with a few exceptions, over this time period.
For the first (1996) cohort, the study documented the different pathways that led recipients to benefit termination. It presented longitudinal statistics on employment, earnings, and use of work incentives, and showed variation in work incentive statistics by state. It then compared selected statistics for more recent cohorts, and considered policy implications of all findings, including implications for TTW and other employment initiatives.
These longitudinal statistics painted a somewhat more optimistic picture of the efforts of recipients to find work compared with the Social Security Administration’s then-published cross-sectional statistics.
The authors also concluded that changing the Disability Insurance program to help recipients increase earnings might not produce program savings even if the changes increased exits from Disability Insurance, because the program might have provided additional support to those who would exit anyway.","","","","","","",""

Specifically, the study looked at the factors women considered when making career decisions, their perceptions of different careers, and the factors that motivated their career choices.
The researchers conducted three interviews with each of 10 participants at two large research universities in the Midwest. All participants were one or two years away from completing their doctorate in chemistry. The study analyzed the data collected to develop a career decision-making model for women in chemistry doctorate programs.
The study found that most participants made career decisions based on their perceptions of the lifestyle required to be successful. Most participants believed that a tenure-track position in a chemistry department was at odds with the traditional female role of primary caretaker in the home. Both single and married women believed that pursuing a research-intensive career would require sacrificing time with family and delaying having children, whereas the sole lesbian participant stated that she did not feel confined to a traditional female family role and was not opposed to the heavy work requirement of a tenure-track university position.
The study also found that women perceived female faculty in their departments to exhibit masculine traits, and believed that it would be necessary to adopt a more masculine personality to be respected and successful in a chemistry department.","","","","","","",""

The study was a randomized controlled trial. Of some 33,000 first-time UI claimants eligible for the study, about 5,100 were randomly assigned to the treatment group, which had to take part in REA and reemployment services (RES) to retain UI eligibility, and the rest were randomly assigned to the control group, which was not required to participate in such services. The authors compared state administrative records on UI benefits to estimate the program’s effectiveness.
The study found statistically significant reductions in weeks of UI benefits receipt, total amount of UI benefits received, total number of weeks receiving UI benefits, and the probability of benefits exhaustion for the treatment group.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it is based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the REA initiative, and not to other factors.","","Since its inception in 2005, 40 states have implemented the REA initiative to encourage rapid reemployment of UI claimants through a combination of in-person eligibility reviews and employment-focused case management. In the Nevada version of REA, active treatment units were required to receive not only REA services but also RES, which were provided by the same staff. REA services included an individual assessment, orientation to the One-Stop Career Center (now known as American Job Center), provision of labor market information, a workforce service workshop, and development of an individual reemployment plan. RES services included job search and resume assistance, job matching against state and federal position databases, and provision of information regarding job training options.
To be eligible for the program, Nevada residents had to be filing first-time UI claims, had received at least one week of benefits under the new claim, had no scheduled return to a previous employer, were not concurrently participating in other training programs; had no exclusive union hiring hall agreements, and were not part of the Worker Profiling and Reemployment Services program.","From July to December 2009, 32,751 first-time UI claimants were determined to be eligible for the program; of these, 5,157 were randomly assigned to the treatment group, which was required to receive REA and RES services. The remaining eligible claimants were assigned to the control group, which was not required to receive REA or RES but had to continue the usual requirements for UI claimants, such as weekly claims filing, conducting an independent job search, and being subject to random quality assurance evaluation. If desired, the control group members could seek out RES on their own.
Administrative data on UI benefits receipt were collected from enrollment in the program until December 2010 (four quarters of data for each claimant). For UI benefits receipt, the authors examined regular UI and Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC), which was also in effect during the period of study. The authors used a regression model to estimate the impacts of the REA program on various UI benefits receipt outcomes. The regression models controlled for gender, race, ethnicity , education, age, occupation group, citizenship, veterans’ status, disability status, maximum UI benefit amount, number of weeks eligible for UI, prior wages, the One-Stop Career Center (now American Job Center) in which the claimant filed his or her claim, and the date of the claim.","The study found the following statistically significant impacts:
REA group members had a lower probability of exhausting their regular UI benefits by 10.4 percentage points compared to the control group.
REA group members were 9.0 percentage points less likely to receive EUC benefits than control group members.
On average, REA group members spent fewer weeks on UI, with an average reduction of 2.96 weeks on any form of UI—1.80 weeks on regular UI and 1.16 weeks on EUC—than the control group.
On average, REA participants received $805 less in total UI benefits—$526 less in regular UI payments and $279 less in EUC payments—than the control group.","During the period of this study, the average annual state unemployment rate reached 13.9 percent, a 25-year record high in the state and the second highest in the nation. This exceptionally high unemployment rate triggered eligibility for weeks of benefits in addition to those available through the regular UI program. It is possible that these additional weeks of available benefits gave the program more opportunities to make an impact on the duration of UI benefits receipt and that such impacts would not be observed during a time of lower unemployment.
This study examined the effect of the combination of REA and RES and thus does not reflect the efficacy of REA in isolation (although the control group was still eligible to receive RES).","",""

The study found no statistically significant impacts on any UI benefits receipt outcomes examined.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it is based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial.

Implementation then began again in August 2009 at 5 of the 12 centers.
REA for UI claimants in Illinois entailed conducting a self-assessment, getting staff assistance recognizing barriers to employment, developing an employment plan, referral to relevant services, review of UI eligibility and work search activities, and sharing labor market information.
To be eligible for REA, UI claimants had to have received at least one UI benefits check, not be residually attached to an employer, and have no union hiring hall connection. In addition, UI claimants had to possess a high-demand skill, based on their previous industry. This last requirement differentiated the Illinois initiative from those studied in other states.","The study evaluated the effectiveness of the REA initiative in Illinois from August 2009 to December 2009 at five One-Stop Career Centers. About 70 percent of the 3,112 eligible claimants were randomized into the treatment group, with the remaining 30 percent assigned to the control group. UI claimants in the treatment group were required to attend REA services to retain UI eligibility. Control group members continued to receive UI benefits with no additional eligibility requirements beyond filing weekly claims, conducting independent job search activities, and being subject to random quality assurance reviews.

This sample is likely not representative of the broader UI claimant population; therefore, the results might not be applicable to all UI claimants more generally.
In addition, the authors suggested that the abrupt halt of REA services at the end of 2008 and their reintroduction in a limited set of One-Stop Career Centers in August 2009 might have adversely affected implementation during the study period, as the programs had recently faced a disruption in service.","",""

The programs’ effectiveness was evaluated using a randomized controlled trial conducted at 21 Youth Corps program sites.
The study found a statistically significant positive impact on participants’ annual income 18 months after random assignment. There was no evidence of statistically significant impacts on employment, education, or training 30 months after random assignment, which was the primary follow-up period examined in the study.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is moderate because, although it was based on a randomized controlled trial with high attrition, the authors demonstrated that the treatment and control groups were similar before the intervention. This means we have confidence that the estimated effects are attributable at least in part to Youth Corps, although other factors could also have contributed.","","Typically, local community-based organizations and state and local government agencies operate Youth Corps programs. The programs’ goals are to positively affect the communities in which they operate, as well as the education and employment outcomes of participants, known as Corpsmembers. In general, Corpsmembers must be at least 16 years old and commit to completing at least 300 hours of service.
There is no single Youth Corps model, but most programs provide educational services, employment and training, and community service activities, along with a modest stipend to participants. Corpsmembers perform a variety of services in their communities, including tutoring, mentoring disadvantaged students, working to improve parks and other public spaces, and helping with disaster relief.
Although populations varied across sites, about 85 percent of Corpsmembers were younger than 25; about 25 percent were African American, 30 percent were Hispanic, and 35 percent were white. Approximately 20 percent of Corpsmembers had education beyond high school, and about 25 percent came from families with incomes below the federal poverty level.","The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted in 21 community-based organizations. Eligible youth were randomly assigned to either receive an offer to participate in Youth Corps immediately or to not be allowed to participate in Youth Corps until 18 months later (the control group). The study team administered follow-up surveys to both groups 18 and 30 months after random assignment to collect data on the outcomes of interest. The sample included more than 1,500 youth who completed an 18-month follow-up survey and nearly 1,300 youth who completed a 30-month follow-up survey.
To estimate the effectiveness of Youth Corps, the authors compared the outcomes of those youth randomly selected to receive an offer to participate in Youth Corps with the outcomes of the control group. The study examined the effects of offering Youth Corps to eligible youth on their employment, education, and training outcomes. The study also examined outcomes related to civic engagement, life skills, risky behavior, and education plans and expectations (not described in this profile).","Youth Corps did not have a statistically significant impact on most of the employment or education outcomes measured 18 months after random assignment. It did, however, have a statistically significant positive impact on annual income: Youth Corps members earned over $1,200 per year more than youths in the control group.
Youth permitted to participate in Youth Corps did not have statistically significantly better employment or education outcomes than the control group when measured 30 months after random assignment.
There were no statistically significant differences in impacts by gender.","The study was based on a randomized controlled trial with high attrition at both follow-up points. However, the authors demonstrated that the treatment and control groups were similar in age, race/ethnicity, and income before the intervention, and they controlled for these characteristics in their analyses.

Although all the women who stayed in a STEM field described the use of coping strategies for persisting in a male-dominated field, these strategies differed among participants. Those who chose to leave their STEM major did not necessarily do so because of a lack of academic preparation, parental support, or competence, but rather seemed to share a feeling that they did not identify with the peers in their STEM field, who they described as “uptight,” “nerdy,” and lacking a life outside of the classroom.","","","","","","",""

Enhanced EHS consisted of the intensive early childhood development services and family supports typical of the EHS program plus program enhancement designed to address parents’ employment and self-sufficiency needs. The enhancements included on-site self-sufficiency specialists who worked directly with families on achieving their self-sufficiency goals, parent training in employment and self-sufficiency issues, establishing partnerships with local agencies that provided employment and training services, and training EHS staff so they could help parents attain their employment and self-sufficiency goals. EHS also offered health and mental health services to families.","From July 2004 to December 2006, evaluators randomly assigned half of the 610 families who met program eligibility criteria to the Enhanced EHS treatment group; the remaining 305 families were assigned to the control group.

Therefore, the review of this study was conducted by an independent consultant trained in applying the CLEAR causal evidence guidelines.","Youth WINS was implemented from August 2006 to January 2010 by the Colorado WIN Partners at the University of Colorado Denver. It was one of six project sites evaluated using a randomized design as part of the larger SSA-sponsored YTD, which intended to help youth with disabilities become more self-sufficient and improve their employment outcomes. Independence teams—composed of a benefits planner, career counselor, and disability program navigator—ensured that youth and their families understood available benefits and services, helped them develop employment goals, and referred them to employment services at partner organizations.
The program targeted current or recent SSA disability recipients ages 14 to 25. The participants were, on average, 20 years old and the primary disability for 60 percent was a mental illness or a cognitive or developmental disability. Most (93 percent) of the treatment group members received case management services, but only about half received employment services. All YTD participants were also eligible for waivers that (1) extended the student earned income exclusion to all YTD participants regardless of age, (2) increased the earned income exclusion to a $1 reduction in Supplemental Security Income benefit for every $4 earned above a base amount, and (3) delayed benefit cessation for YTD participants who were determined ineligible for benefits after a benefit review or age-18 SSI medical redetermination.","The study was a randomized controlled trial in which 468 youth were randomly assigned to the treatment group and 387 to the control group. Data were collected from a baseline survey, a 12-month follow-up survey, and SSA’s TRF and MEF. The TRF supplied data on benefit receipt status, benefit amounts paid, and disabling condition, whereas the MEF provided baseline earnings information. Regression-adjusted impacts were estimated for several outcomes, such as paid employment, earnings, educational attainment, monthly Social Security disability benefit receipt, and total income from earnings and benefits.","Youth WINS achieved no statistically significant impacts on paid employment, earnings, educational attainment, Social Security disability benefit receipt, or total income over the 12-month follow-up period.","The authors attributed the lack of impacts to inadequate implementation of the YTD program model’s job development and job placement components, as well as the inability of Youth WINS’ partners to provide substantial employment services to all of the youth referred by the independence teams. In addition, only 86 percent of youth assigned to the treatment group actually enrolled in Youth WINS.","Boulder County, Colorado

The authors conducted regression analysis using data from the 2004–2007 National Study of Living Learning Programs (NSLLP) to determine if women who participated in female-only STEM living-learning programs were more likely than women in other living arrangements to express plans to attend graduate school in a STEM field.
The study found that the female undergraduate STEM majors living in a female-only STEM living-learning community were more likely to have plans to attend graduate school in a STEM field than female STEM majors living in coeducational STEM living-learning communities, non-STEM living-learning communities, or traditional residence halls.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors’ analysis did not account for important individual characteristics related to the outcome that could differ across groups. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to female-only STEM living-learning programs. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Living-learning programs offer undergraduate students the opportunity to live in a designated community with other students sharing a common interest and to participate in academic and extracurricular activities related to that interest. This study examined female-only and coeducational living-learning programs focused on STEM fields, as well as living-learning programs that did not focus on STEM fields. Participating universities were four-year universities with on-campus housing facilities.","The study used data from the 2004–2007 NSLLP. The authors conducted regression analysis to identify the relationship between participating in an all-female STEM living-learning program during the first year of college and participants’ plans to attend graduate school in STEM fields, measured three years later. Outcomes for students who chose to participate in all-female STEM living-learning programs were compared with outcomes of students who chose coeducational STEM living-learning communities, non-STEM living-learning communities, and traditional residence halls. The study sample included 294 undergraduate women pursuing STEM degrees.","The study found that the female STEM majors living in a female-only STEM living-learning community were significantly more likely to have plans to attend graduate school in a STEM field than female STEM majors living in coeducational STEM living-learning communities (by 35 percent), non-STEM living-learning communities (by 31 percent), or traditional residence halls (by 29 percent).","This study did not account for selection into the treatment condition. Women who chose to participate in a STEM living-learning program might have had unobservable characteristics that made them more likely to plan to pursue graduate studies in a STEM field. For this reason, estimated impacts might reflect the effects of such factors in addition to any effects of the female-only STEM living-learning community.
The study also had a very low response rate. Only 16 of the original 34 schools agreed to participate in the second round of data collection; among the women in those schools who were surveyed in the first round, only 20.9 percent responded in the second round. The low response rate raises concerns that the findings might not be generalizable to a broader population of female STEM majors.","",""

About 2,000 volunteers were randomly assigned as part of the demonstration; this report focuses on approximately 1,500 of them. Study data sources included Social Security Administration (SSA) administrative records, a baseline telephone survey, a follow-up 12-month survey, health claims data, and a case management information system.
ABD health insurance increased health care utilization, reduced unmet medical care needs, and improved self-reported health. However, ABD employment supports did not increase employment in the first 12 months of follow-up.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this report is high because the study is a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we can be confident that the outcome differences between research groups are attributable to ABD, and not other factors.","","Almost all new SSDI recipients must wait 24 months after their SSDI eligibility date to be eligible for Medicare benefits. Some SSDI recipients have no health insurance during this Medicare waiting period. The ABD provided health insurance to new, uninsured SSDI recipients (that is, no concurrent SSI/SSDI recipients), ages 18 to 54, who had at least 18 months to wait before Medicare eligibility.
For the demonstration, 1,997 volunteers living in 53 qualifying U.S. metropolitan areas were randomly assigned to receive either accelerated benefits (AB), AB Plus, or no additional services (that is, control). Both AB and AB Plus members received immediate health insurance with greater benefit coverage, lower copayments, and a more comprehensive provider network than Medicare. AB Plus members were also eligible for three voluntary services delivered by telephone: a behavioral health motivation program, employment and public assistance benefits counseling, and medical case management. The report’s analysis sample includes 1,531 people randomly assigned to one of the three experimental groups on or before November 6, 2008, because after that date random assignment into AB Plus was ended due to budgetary pressures.","The study’s data sources include SSA administrative records, a baseline telephone survey, a follow-up 12-month survey, health claims data for members of each of the two program groups (AB and AB plus), and a case management information system.
The impact of accelerated health insurance coverage was estimated as the difference between the AB group and the control group, whereas the impact of accelerated health insurance coverage plus supportive services was estimated as the difference between the AB Plus group and the control group. The incremental impact of the supportive services was estimated as the difference between the AB Plus group and the AB group. All impacts were regression-adjusted to account for differences in baseline characteristics across groups.","Accelerated health care benefits improved self-reported health across a variety of measures, including a 10 percentage point increase in those rating their health as good, very good, or excellent in the AB group and a 7 percentage point increase in the same measure for the AB Plus group. Both AB and AB Plus also increased health care utilization.
Relative to those who just received AB, the supportive services available to the AB Plus group did not increase employment in the first 12 months.","The study period coincided with the 2007–2009 U.S. recession, which might have dampened any short-term employment impacts. This report is limited to 12-month impacts, but the overall effectiveness of the program might depend upon employment impacts and health impacts that are not expected to materialize until approximately five years after random assignment.","",""

The study was a randomized controlled trial carried out with 17 different student cohorts from eight participating colleges, universities, and technical schools. For this review, CLEAR distinguished between sites with a 50/50 probability of assignment to coaching and sites with other probabilities of assignment. The authors assessed the program’s impact on retention rates using academic records for all students who participated in the study.
The study found that on average, both in sites with a 50/50 probability of assignment and all sites combined, students participating in InsideTrack demonstrated increased persistence compared with control group students receiving only the regular suite of career or academic support services.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report for sites with a 50/50 probability of assignment is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects for these sites are attributable to InsideTrack and not to other factors. The quality of causal evidence presented in this report for all sites combined is low because randomization was compromised and the analysis did not include sufficient controls. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects for the full sample are attributable to InsideTrack. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","InsideTrack is an independent provider of voluntary student coaching services for institutions of higher education. InsideTrack matches students to potential coaches, who work to help students prioritize their studies, plan for academic success, and identify and overcome barriers to academic success. A coach typically worked with a student for two semesters, and spent significant time assessing students’ lives outside of school in such areas as personal time commitments, primary caregiving responsibilities, and financial obligations. In addition to regular contact, coaches sometimes had access to course information and students’ performance in their specific courses. This information was used in an algorithm that directed coaches to specific issues to address. The ultimate goal of InsideTrack was to improve college retention and completion.
Each participating institution established its own eligibility criteria for study inclusion independent of the service provider, IndsideTrack. Different institutions restricted eligibility in different ways, some focusing on students in later years of study, some on new entrants, and some on full- or part-time students. Older and nontraditional students were more heavily represented in the study sample than in the institutions’ general student population, with only about 25 percent of participants younger than 23.","Across eight universities, 13,555 students were randomly assigned to the treatment or control groups and considered in the reported analysis. The authors conducted regression analyses controlling for gender, age, high school grade point average, American College Test scores, Scholastic Assessment Test scores, residential location, Pell grant status, merit scholarship status, remediation in math or English, and school type.","The study found that, on average among students in sites with a 50/50 probability of assignment, InsideTrack significantly increased persistence in college after 6, 12, and 18 months by 4, 5, and 7 percentage points, respectively.
There was no statistically significant effect on degree completion.","Although the study was designed and implemented as a randomized controlled trial, the authors reassigned some students in sites with non-50/50 probabilities of assignment, jeopardizing the study design. Even though the authors reassigned very few students and did so to improve balance on observable characteristics between the treatment and control groups, CLEAR considers studies with any post-random assignment manipulation of the research groups as nonexperimental designs. Because the authors neither established baseline equivalence nor controlled for all relevant background characteristics in their analysis, these sites receive a low evidence rating.
Across sites, the study reported only intent-to-treat findings, which can be interpreted as the impact of being offered the treatment. Participation was optional, so assignment to coaching did not guarantee participation. As a result, the program’s impact on students who actually participated might be higher than the study’s estimates.","",""

In the four experiments discussed here, the authors collected data directly from participants by administering post-intervention surveys or collecting hypothetical asset allocation information.

Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.
Further, the intervention was conducted in a single setting such that it is possible that the effects of the intervention might fade over time. Given that no pre-test was administered, we do not know how much the baseline attitudes changed due to the intervention across the treatment and control groups and cannot draw conclusions about how long we would expect the intervention effects to last.","",""

The author assigned workers to the treatment group if they received employment-related services through the WIA Adult Program from January 2002 to June 2008. Workers who participated in the Labor Exchange program during this time comprised the comparison group.
The study found no statistically significant relationships between receiving services through the WIA Adult Program and quarterly earnings.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the author did not ensure that the groups being compared were similar before program participation. This means we would not be confident that the estimated effects would be attributable to the WIA Adult Program; however, the study did not find statistically significant effects.","","The WIA Adult Program was authorized by Title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 and was superseded by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), effective in July 2015. The Adult Program services remained similar under WIOA and were designed to provide quality employment and training services to eligible workers. Administered through Local Workforce Investment Areas, the Adult Program serves all people ages 18 years and older through core services; these include job placement assistance, skills assessments, and provision of information on the labor market, among other services. In addition, those unable to obtain a job through core services alone could receive intensive services—which included counseling and specialized assessments—and vouchers for attending training. Recipients of public assistance and other low-income people received priority for intensive and training services in Local Workforce Investment Areas in which program funds were limited. In addition, some local areas provided supportive services such as child care, transportation, and work-related financial assistance to those who qualified.","The study included a sample of 5,677 workers who received services through the WIA Adult Program and 12,360 workers who received services through the Labor Exchange program from January 2002 to June 2008 in Washington State. The study participants were ages 18 to 64 throughout the course of the study. The WIA Adult Program participants were 58 percent female and 28 percent nonwhite. Those in the comparison group were 47 percent were female and 23 percent nonwhite.
The authors used administrative data sources, including the Services, Knowledge and Information Exchange System and Unemployment Insurance records, to compare the quarterly earnings of WIA participants with those of Labor Exchange participants who exited the program at the same time.","The study found no statistically significant relationships between receiving services through the WIA Adult Program and quarterly earnings.","Although the author accounted for many underlying characteristics of the groups being compared, which could also influence their outcomes, the author’s decision to define the groups based on their date of program exit rather than program entry is problematic. For example, suppose that the WIA and Labor Exchange participants were on identical wage trajectories before receiving services from their respective programs and that the average length of participation in WIA services was six months, whereas that for Labor Exchange was one month. At the conclusion of participation, they exited the program.
If we compared the groups’ earnings 6 months after their recorded exit dates, we would be looking at WIA participants’ earnings about 12 months after they started receiving services and Labor Exchange participants’ earnings about 7 months after they started receiving services. If both programs were completely ineffective, and everyone stayed on their original upward-sloping wage trajectory, it would appear as though the WIA participants earned more 6 months after their exit dates. However, this would not be attributable to receiving WIA services; it would be caused by the different elapsed time across the groups (12 months for WIA participants versus 7 months for Labor Exchange participants). Therefore, studies defining the groups based on exit date, rather than entry date, cannot receive a moderate causal evidence rating.","",""

The authors conducted a randomized controlled trial. They used Unemployment Insurance (UI) records of the full sample and a follow-up survey conducted on average seven years after random assignment for a random subsample of the full sample (4,800 of 7,920) to determine education and training, employment, and earnings outcomes.
The study found that a significantly higher percentage of the maximum customer choice group (59 percent) had earned a certificate or degree from a training program within 3 years of random assignment compared with the guided customer choice group (53 percent).
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the ITA models, and not to other factors.","","The study examined dislocated workers and other adults who were new customers of the participating Workforce Investment Area (WIA) agencies who were eligible for ITAs. WIAs have flexibility in how they implement ITAs, which customers use to fund training programs of their choice from a wide selection of state-approved providers. The ITA experiment tested three alternative ways to manage customers’ choices of training programs: structured customer choice, guided customer choice, and maximum customer choice.
Dislocated workers and adults (18 years of age and older) eligible for WIA training assigned to the structured customer choice group received intensive, mandatory weekly counseling. Counselors directed clients to training selections that maximized return on investment and could reject clients’ choices that did not do so. Workers in this condition could also use an ITA to cover the full cost of training (up to $8,000). Those assigned to the guided customer choice group received less intensive but still mandatory weekly counseling that guided them to appropriate training selections. Counselors could not reject clients’ choices under this condition. Those in the guided customer choice group also received a fixed ITA established for their area ($3,000 to $5,000). Those assigned to the maximum customer choice group did not automatically receive, but could request, counseling to guide them to appropriate training selections and received a fixed ITA established for their area ($3,000 to $5,000). Under each condition, regional workforce boards and human services departments provided program services.","The study examined dislocated workers and other adults who were new customers of the participating WIA agencies who were eligible for ITAs. To be eligible, customers had to be determined as in need of training, have the skills and qualifications to complete training, have received at least one core and one intensive service, be unable to obtain funding assistance to pay for training from other sources, and consent to participate in the study. The authors randomly assigned 7,920 customers to one of the three models tested. They used UI records of the full sample and a follow-up survey conducted on average seven years after random assignment for a random subsample of the full sample (4,800 of 7,920) to determine education and training, employment, and earnings outcomes. The authors estimated impacts for each site using statistical models that accounted for group assignment and participants’ baseline characteristics.","The study found that 59 percent of the maximum customer choice group had earned a certificate or degree from a training program within three years of random assignment, which was significantly higher than the 53 percent of the guided customer choice group that had earned a certificate or degree. This finding was significant at the 5 percent level.","Outcomes based on data that did not focus on job spells are rated high because the study is a randomized controlled trial and attrition was low. For the employment and earnings outcomes, the authors did not establish that attrition was low or that the groups were similar in their characteristics before the intervention began. As a result, these outcomes received a low evidence rating and are not reported here.","Phoenix, Arizona

Evidence from a field experiment","The study’s objective was to examine the impact of providing information about Social Security rules and benefits on labor force participation, knowledge of Social Security, and claiming of Social Security benefits.
Workers nearing retirement age were randomly assigned into either the treatment group, which was sent an informational brochure about Social Security and invited to a 15-minute web tutorial on Social Security provisions, or to the control group, which was not offered this information but could seek other publicly available information about Social Security. The authors measured outcomes through a follow-up survey conducted 13 months after random assignment.
The study found that, on average, members of the treatment group were more likely to work for pay in the last month and were more likely to be aware that Social Security benefits were based on the number of years with the highest earnings, compared with the control group. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups on any other outcomes related to earnings and employment, Social Security benefit receipt, or understanding Social Security rules.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it was based on a well-conducted randomized controlled trial with high attrition and adequate control variables. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to providing information about Social Security provisions, but other factors might also have contributed.","","","The authors investigated whether a relatively low-cost intervention could impact workers’ knowledge of and choices associated with claiming Social Security benefits. Knowledge Networks, a data collection firm, identified participants for the study via random-digit dialing and collected a survey covering demographic and employment characteristics in November 2008.
To be eligible for the study, workers had to be 55 years of age or older, employed, and covered by Social Security at the time of random assignment. Approximately 90 percent of the sample was 60 to 65 years old. The 2,483 eligible individuals in the sample were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group. Individuals randomly assigned to the treatment group were offered additional information about Social Security provisions in two ways: (1) an informational brochure that was mailed to them and (2) a 15-minute web tutorial. The brochure was generic and all members of the treatment group received the same version. The web tutorial was tailored to each individual, with specific examples that fit the characteristics of that individual, such as their age, gender, and length of time in the labor force. Individuals randomly assigned to the control group received no additional information, but could access other publicly available information about Social Security.
A follow-up survey was fielded from April to June 2010 to collect demographic and outcomes data for study participants. The authors estimated the impact of being offered additional information on Social Security provisions using regression analyses, controlling for demographic characteristics. The primary outcomes examined were labor force participation, claiming of Social Security benefits, hours worked and earned income, and multiple measures of understanding Social Security benefits rules and provisions.","The study found that the treatment group was about four percentage points more likely to have worked for pay in the past month, compared with the control group; this difference was statistically significant. The study found no statistically significant differences between the treatment and control groups on earnings, hours worked, or Social Security benefit receipt.
The study found that the treatment group was about six percentage points more likely to be aware that Social Security benefits were based on the number of years with the highest earnings, compared with the control group. This was a statistically significant difference. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the treatment and control groups on any other measures of understanding Social Security rules and provisions, or on the age at which individuals retired or started claiming Social Security benefits.","Although the study design was a randomized controlled trial, the study had high attrition because not all study participants responded to the follow-up survey. Therefore, the study is not eligible to receive a high causal evidence rating. However, the authors demonstrated that the study groups included in the analysis had equivalent demographic characteristics, educational backgrounds, and household incomes. Therefore, the study receives a moderate causal evidence rating.
Only 33 percent of individuals in the treatment group recalled receiving the informational brochure. The low recall rate suggests that the informational brochure had not made much of an impression on study participants, which is further reflected in the few statistically significant impacts of the intervention. However, the intervention was also very low-cost, so even very small impacts may be cost-effective.","",""

The research examined faculty rank, tenure, career track, leadership opportunities, and salary, and aimed to inform RIT’s efforts to recruit, retain, and advance female STEM faculty.
The authors used institutional records from 2004 to 2010 to measure trends in recruitment, retention, advancement, and compensation, by faculty gender. A career-life survey administered to gather information on STEM faculty’s teaching and research experiences, including career satisfaction and work-life balance, complemented the institutional data. The authors tested for statistically significant differences in responses between men and women. Finally, the study benchmarked university policies and survey results against policies and survey results at other similar universities.
In terms of retention, the study found that female faculty hired from 2002 to 2009 were twice as likely to have left RIT by 2010 than male faculty and, overall, the institution had a significantly lower percentage of female science and engineering tenured and tenure-track faculty in 2010 than the national average.
In terms of leadership advancement and salary, the percentage of STEM leadership positions held by women in 2010 was proportional to the percentage of STEM faculty who were women. The study found that salary adjustments made by the university during the study period reduced the salary gap for female assistant and associate professors, but actually increased the gap for full professors. In the survey, women reported having to exert more effort and make more personal sacrifices to advance their careers than men, though most women felt that the tenure process was fair.

Two years after launching the needs assessment, the authors administered a follow-up survey to gauge the program’s progress.
The initial needs assessment found substantial gender differences in associate professors’ perceptions of the promotion process. Women were significantly more likely than men to believe that departmental standards for promotion were unclear, that their department chair did not provide career support or guidance, and that factors such as race and gender would influence the promotion process.
Responses to the follow-up survey marked a significant increase in the proportion of associate professors reporting having a mentor and lessening of gender disparities regarding perceptions of the promotion process.

The author used data from the Higher Education Research Institute Cooperative Institutional Research Program at the University of California, Los Angeles, to model whether college experiences mediated some of the effect of precollege characteristics and institutional settings on persistence in STEM majors, as hypothesized. Survey data were collected when students entered college in 2004 and again in the spring of 2008, during students’ fourth year of college. The study included a sample of 1,250 women of color and 891 white women at four-year colleges and universities across the United States who were first-time, full-time students. Results were estimated separately for women of color and white women.
The study found that both white women and women of color persisted in STEM at a rate of 57 percent from the time they stated an intent to major in STEM at college entrance to the spring semester of their fourth year, and that high school grade point average was a significant predictor of persistence for both groups. As hypothesized, college experiences had a significant effect on the persistence of women of color in STEM: those who found satisfaction with their curriculum, engaged in peer discussion on course content outside the classroom, joined a major-related club, tutored another student, participated in research programs, and intended to major in engineering were more likely to persist in a STEM major; the same factors were significant for white women, with the exception of joining a major-related club. In addition, women of color who attended a private college and an institution with a higher percentage of students majoring in STEM were more likely to stay in a STEM major; the opposite was true for women of color who attended a highly selective institution.

The SPIRIT program, which took place during two weeks in summer 2009 at a large Midwestern university, had female and male students use a three-dimensional programming environment called Alice to create animations for storytelling. Participants also completed other hands-on activities and heard presentations from professionals on the use of IT in their jobs.
The authors administered 20-item baseline and follow-up surveys to students on general attitudes toward and gender stereotypes in IT and compared responses before and after the SPIRIT program. Of the76 students who attended the program, 74 participated in the study. Because the program aimed to increase girls’ interests in IT, the study sample was 70 percent female.
The study found that, after attending the SPIRIT program, female students demonstrated no change in general attitudes toward IT, but showed a significant reduction in believing the gender stereotype that women do not perform as well as men in IT.
In looking at emergent themes of open-ended survey responses, the authors found that women’s attitudes toward the characteristics of a person with a career in IT changed from a focus on the person’s skills or intelligence before participation in SPIRIT to a more diverse description of characteristics after participation in the program. Similarly, female students provided a more expansive set of example IT careers after participation in SPIRIT. The authors did not conduct statistical tests on these differences.","","","","","","",""

The authors administered two tests, the Middle School Attitude to Mathematics, Science and Engineering Survey (MATE) and the Draw an Engineer Test (DAET), to about 100 participants in a summer 2009 New Jersey Institute of Technology engineering program for 4th- to 8th-grade girls. The MATE comprises seven psychological subscales focused on students’ interest in various aspects of engineering, attitudes toward mathematics and science, problem-solving, knowledge of engineering, and perceptions of males’ and females’ relative competence in mathematics and science; the DAET prompts respondents to draw an engineer at work and summarize their drawing in a sentence. Participants took both tests before beginning and after completing the program.
The study found that girls’ knowledge of engineering increased significantly; at the beginning of the study, fewer than half of the participants could name one or more kinds of engineers, but by the end of the program more than 85 percent of participants correctly identified at least one kind of engineer.
Differences in pre- and post-program engineer drawings and descriptions suggested more nuanced changes in girls’ understanding of engineering. For example, the proportion of responses depicting engineers communicating with others more than doubled, from only 12 percent before the program to 30 percent afterward. The authors concluded that the DAET complements the MATE and warranted further study as a measure of children’s changing perceptions of science and scientists.","","","","","","",""

Using a randomized controlled trial design, the authors estimated the program’s impact by comparing survey responses and college records for youth randomly selected to receive the Outreach program with those of youth randomly assigned to the control group.
The study found that the Outreach program significantly increased college enrollment and persistence.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Massachusetts Adolescent Outreach Program for Youths in Intensive Foster Care, and not to other factors.","","The study examined the Massachusetts Adolescent Outreach Program for Youths in Intensive Foster Care (Outreach). Outreach was funded by the John Chafee Foster Care Independence Program, created under the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999, which provided funding and afforded flexibility to states in providing support to youths transitioning to independent living. The goals of Outreach included empowering youths to develop the skills of an independent adult, supporting participation in higher education, achieving permanency through a connection to a caring adult, and identifying a support network. Outreach had previously been available only to youth in regular foster care placements, but to conduct the evaluation, it expanded to aid those in intensive foster care who previously did not have access. Youth in intensive foster care are likely to have greater mental, emotional, and physical needs than those in regular foster care.
Outreach participants were paired with caseworkers who helped them prepare to live independently after exiting the care of the Department of Children and Families (DCF). Outreach staff helped youth with tasks such as obtaining a driver’s license, applying for college, and getting a job. Staff tailored services to each participant based on a youth development model and the youths’ own goals. When youth achieved the goals they set for the Outreach program, they were removed from the Outreach caseload, but continued to meet monthly with their Outreach caseworkers for six months to check in on their progress.","The study included 194 foster care youth born from August 1985 to December 1990. To be eligible for the study, youth had to be in intensive foster care in Massachusetts, have a service plan goal of independent living or long-term substitute care, and be deemed appropriate for the program by the youth’s DCF caseworker. Participants were excluded from the study if they were reunited with a parent, had a caregiver who was a legal guardian, were living outside Massachusetts or the immediate surrounding area, were on runaway status for at least three consecutive months, or were mentally incapable of completing an interview. The study sample was 67.0 percent female, 72.7 percent white, 24.7 percent black, 26.8 percent Hispanic, and had an average age of 16.9 years at baseline (age ranged from 15 to 20). Also at baseline, youth had completed an average of 9.9 grades of schooling, 6.7 percent had graduated high school or obtained a general equivalency degree (GED), and 4.1 percent attended college.
Half of the eligible youth were randomly assigned to receive Outreach services (n = 97) and the other half received regular foster care services (n = 97). The authors estimated the program’s impact by comparing survey responses and college records for youth in the Outreach group and youth in the regular foster care group.","The study found that significantly more Outreach youth reported being enrolled in college than youth in the regular foster care group (55.7 versus 37.4 percent).
The study also found that a significantly greater percentage of Outreach youth persisted in college for at least one year compared with youth in the regular foster care group (48.9 versus 30.8 percent).
None of the other outcomes of interest (grade completion, diploma/GED attainment, employment, earnings, and benefit receipt) were significantly different across groups.","In addition to presenting differences in means, the study reported results using logistic regression analyses to adjust for baseline differences in demographics, behavior, and care between the groups. The results of these analyses largely confirmed those of the mean comparisons, which are presented in the CLEAR profile because they are more straightforward to interpret.
The authors noted that up to 10 control youth had some contact with Outreach caseworkers but that it was unlikely they received services from the program. Nevertheless, given the small sample size, this crossover might have weakened the contrast between the study groups.","",""

The analysis used data from the Master Earnings File (MEF) and Master Beneficiary Record (MBR). The authors reported unadjusted and regression-adjusted program impacts.
The study found that the BOPD had no earnings impacts but increased the probability of earning above the annualized SGA amount one and two years after baseline. The intervention also increased the average SSDI benefit payment to participants.
The quality of the evidence presented in this study is high because it is based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the BOPD, and not to other factors.","","Administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA), the BOPD was a pilot test of the later Benefit Offset National Demonstration, which tested variants of SSDI program rules designed to increase the incentive for SSDI recipients to work and reduce their reliance on benefits. The primary intervention is a benefit offset that replaces the so-called cash cliff SSDI recipients who work eventually experience. The cash cliff refers to the fact that SSDI recipients who have completed a nine-month trial work period followed by a three-month grace period have all their SSDI benefits suspended or terminated if they earn more than the substantial gainful activity (SGA) amount. The benefit offset replaces the complete loss of all benefits for working SSDI recipients, instead gradually withdrawing the SSDI benefit by $1 for every $2 earned above the SGA amount.
BOPD was implemented in four states: Connecticut, Utah, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Apart from recruiting SSDI recipients who received benefits solely based on their own earnings records, had completed a trial work period within the past 72 months, and were not concurrently receiving Supplemental Security Income benefits, the states were free to select their own program eligibility criteria. This study examined employment and earnings impacts across all four BOPD states.","The BOPD was a randomized controlled trial. Eligible SSDI recipients who volunteered for the program were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group. The treatment group was offered the benefit offset policy, whereas the control group faced current SSDI program rules. The analysis relied primarily on SSA administrative data. Evaluation data sources included the MEF for annual earnings data and MBR for SSDI program participation information. State-specific data were used to gather the identifiers needed to identify BOPD participants in SSA administrative records.","The study found no statistically significant impacts on employment rates or earnings during the study period.
The benefit offset significantly increased the probability of having annual earnings above the annualized SGA amount both one and two years after random assignment by approximately 4 percentage points.
BOPD increased the overall dollar amount of SSDI benefits paid to participants. The treatment group received $519 and $544 more in SSDI benefits in the first and second years after random assignment, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in benefits received between the treatment and control groups during the year of random assignment.","The volunteers who participated in the BOPD are not likely to be representative of the larger SSDI recipient population because they were typically recruited from organizations that helped clients obtain employment, and are therefore likely to be representative of the 20 percent of SSDI recipients who report an expectation of returning to work. In addition, the decision by SSA to restrict eligibility to SSDI recipients who completed their trial work period within the past 72 months disqualified potential participants with longer work histories; these people might have benefited the most from the program.","Connecticut

The authors conducted in-depth site visits to eight selected study sites and analyzed the data using qualitative methods.

The longer time frame for the work experiences was seen as a benefit by participants and employers. Post-SYEI programs also focused on ensuring the alignment between participants’ interests and their work experiences.
The authors recommended three considerations for the design of similar policies targeting older out-of-school youth in the future: allowing sufficient time to design such programs, because the needs of older out-of-school youth differ from those of younger youth who are traditionally served by these types of programs; supporting a year-round, not only summer, work experience; and incorporating a transition strategy from the work experience into future opportunities.","","","","","","",""

This profile focused on the implementation analysis.
The study examined implementation of ABD in 53 qualifying U.S. metropolitan areas, focusing on service delivery and use, and challenges and solutions to implementation. The authors conducted qualitative analysis of interviews with program staff, discussions from regular team meetings, and a document review, along with quantitative analysis of health plan claims and service use data from the AB Plus management information system.
Overall, the study found that almost all program group members used the AB health plan. Most members of the AB Plus group, which had access to additional programming, completed intake and a substantial proportion used services. Under the AB Plus plan, the behavioral motivational coaching and employment and benefits counseling were largely implemented as designed, but the intake process and medical case management were refined over time.
Because of limitations in the study’s discussion of its research methods, it is unclear whether findings are potentially applicable to other projects that provide employment-related services to people with disabilities.","","Almost all new SSDI recipients must wait 24 months after their SSDI eligibility date to be eligible for Medicare benefits. Some SSDI recipients have no health insurance during this Medicare waiting period. The ABD provided health insurance to new, uninsured SSDI recipients (that is, no concurrent Supplemental Security Income/SSDI recipients), ages 18 to 54, who had at least 18 months to wait before Medicare eligibility.
For the demonstration, 1,997 volunteers living in 53 qualifying U.S. metropolitan areas were randomly assigned to receive either AB, AB Plus, or no additional services (that is, control). AB and AB Plus members received immediate health insurance with greater benefits coverage, lower copayments, and a more comprehensive provider network than Medicare. AB Plus members were also eligible for three voluntary services delivered by telephone: a behavioral health motivation program, employment and public assistance benefits counseling, and medical case management.
Expected effects of ABD included increased health care use; reduced reported unmet medical needs and out-of-pocket medical expenses; increased short-term employment, use of employment supports, and use of vocational rehabilitation services to return to work; improved health and functioning; and ultimately, increased employment and reduced SSDI payments. POMCO, a third-party benefits administrator, administered the health plan, and Medco, a pharmacy benefits manager, administered prescription drug claims. Coaches and nurses from CareGuide, a national disease management company, delivered the coaching and medical case management under the AB Plus program. Counselors from TransCen, which specializes in employment and benefits counseling for people with disabilities, administered this counseling under the program.","The implementation portion of the study sought to describe the first year of ABD implementation. The study described major aspects of implementation, including the target population, inputs and resources, service delivery, and participants’ characteristics. The study drew on program documents; telephone interviews with program staff and minutes from regular team meetings held among program staff, advisors, and the study team; service provision data from the program’s management information system, and baseline and 12-month follow-up surveys of participants. The study was conducted from October 2007 through July 2010, with interviews occurring in 2008 and 2010.","The implementation analysis found that service use was high: almost all those randomly assigned to the AB or AB Plus groups used the AB health plan during the year after random assignment. Almost 90 percent had at least one paid claim and very few members disenrolled. Total claims for the AB health plan in its first year were nearly $19.5 million, with average total claims of $19,265. Those who reported being in poor health at enrollment had higher claim payments than those who reported being in fair or better health (average expenditures were $21,402 and $17,377, respectively). Those with primary diagnoses of neoplasm (usually related to a form of cancer) had higher claim payments than those without that diagnosis (average expenditures were $39,697 and $17,072, respectively)
For AB Plus, two-thirds of participants used at least one of the three voluntary services offered during the year after random assignment: about 36 percent participated in coaching, 42 percent in case management, 35 percent in counseling, and more than 10 percent participated in all three services.
The AB Plus program faced several challenges in delivering the three voluntary services to participants and, as a result, modified the service delivery approach over the course of implementation.
 Intake process. The intake process for AB Plus involved a formal medical assessment to identify barriers, including mental health disorders, and target services appropriately, including referrals to medical case management. Staff felt that this discouraged participants, so they began gathering this information through several telephone calls instead.
Coaching and benefits counseling. As time went on, AB Plus was redesigned to focus more at overcoming short-term health barriers to starting coaching, and to help group members reintegrate into physical, social, and occupational activities. Coaches and benefits counselors had flexibility to adapt the delivery and duration of their modules and lessons. However, low literacy made it difficult for some participants to self-administer assessments and respond to writing assignments. Coaches or counselors would administer assignments, but this was time-consuming and not always appropriate for the lessons.
Maintaining contact. Not all participants contacted employment counselors after a referral, so staff initiated a warm transfer process to encourage contact. Overall, considerable resources were used to maintain contact with participants.
Case management. The program group had a wider range of diagnoses and limitations than participants in previous demonstrations, making it difficult to apply a standard approach to case management. As a result, nurses and coaches tailored case management to focus on addressing specific short-term barriers to starting behavioral motivational coaching.
Other barriers. Some AB Plus participants had serious financial problems and needed assistance for basic purchases, such as food and shelter, or help with managing debt. These needs had to be met before participants would consider taking part in AB Plus services, so staff shared financial assistance resources with them.","The study clearly identified the research questions and explored an array of data sources to explore them. The study included a systematic description of findings, which were supported by qualitative data, and quantitative claims and service use data. However, the study would have benefited from including a more thorough description of its respondent sources, data collection techniques, analysis methods, and data quality control techniques. Also, the study did not interview program group participants, which would have been a relevant source for triangulating findings. Given the lack of description of study methods, the study findings might not apply to other health care plan and return-to-work programs for SSDI beneficiaries and people with disabilities.","",""

DMIE was implemented in Hawaii, Kansas, Minnesota, and Texas with the aim of preventing or delaying people with disabilities from leaving the workforce and applying for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits.
The study was a randomized controlled trial examining DMIE’s impact on employment, hours worked, and benefits applications. Study data sources included the Ticket Research File (TRF), 831 File, and Uniform Data Set (UDS). Because DMIE recruitment methods, participant populations, and services offered varied substantially across states, the authors reported impacts separately for each state and for Minnesota and Texas pooled together.
With few exceptions, DMIE did not achieve statistically significant impacts on employment, hours worked, or disability benefit applications.
The quality of causal evidence is high for most outcomes, which means that we are confident that the estimated impacts are attributable solely to the DMIE. However, for some outcomes including employment in Kansas and Hawaii, the quality of the causal evidence is moderate, which means that we have confidence that the estimated effects are attributable at least in part to the DMIE, though other factors might also have contributed.","","The DMIE, which was authorized under the 1999 Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act and funded by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, aimed to delay or prevent reliance on Social Security disability benefits through medical assistance and other supports. Hawaii, Kansas, Minnesota, and Texas received federal funding to design and test innovative programs to obtain this objective. Each state provided health care services beyond existing health insurance coverage, as well as discounted deductibles, premiums, and copayments. DMIE participants also received employment services such as vocational rehabilitation and service coordination and a personal case manager. DMIE enrollment occurred from 2006 through 2008 and varied by state. All DMIE services expired on September 30, 2009.
The age range for eligible participants varied slightly across states but was roughly 18 to 62. Eligible participants also had to work at least 40 hours per month, not have pending disability applications, and neither be receiving Social Security disability benefits nor have pending applications for benefits. Minnesota (888 treatment and 267 control group members) and Texas (888 treatment and 697 control group members) recruited low-income residents with severe mental illness from certain parts of the states. In Texas, participants also had to be uninsured and have a physical disability. Kansas (225 treatment and 275 control group members) recruited statewide participants with both physical and mental disabilities from its high-risk insurance pool and Hawaii (124 treatment and 60 control group members) recruited people with diabetes who lived in the city and county of Honolulu. Given the different recruitment strategies, participants varied across states in terms of age, marital status, ethnicity, college degree attainment rates, physical and mental capabilities, and employment characteristics.","The study was a randomized controlled trial examining DMIE’s impact on employment, earnings, benefit applications and receipt, and health status. In Hawaii, 124 eligible participants were randomly assigned to a treatment group eligible to receive DMIE services and 60 were assigned to a control group that could not access DMIE services. The treatment and control group sample size in Kansas was 225 and 275, respectively; in Minnesota, it was 888 and 267, respectively; and in Texas, it was 888 and 697, respectively. Because the recruitment methods, participant populations, and services offered varied substantially across sites, the authors reported impacts separately for each of the four sites. The authors found that participants in Minnesota and Texas were similar enough to pool, so they also estimated impacts for the two states pooled together.
This analysis estimated regression-adjusted impact estimates based on outcomes measured 6 to 12 months after enrollment. The UDS data included demographic information (age, gender, and race); self-reported health status; baseline employment; percentage working in past month; and monthly hours worked. In addition, the analysis relied on Social Security Administration administrative data files: the TRF provided data on disabling conditions and the 831 file supplied disability benefit application information.","With few exceptions, DMIE did not achieve statistically significant impacts on employment, hours worked, or disability benefit applications in the four states examined.
In Kansas, treatment group members had a 4.6 percentage point higher employment rate than control group members. In Hawaii, treatment group members worked 31.4 fewer hours, on average, than control group members. And participants in the pooled Minnesota and Texas sample were 2 percentage points less likely to submit an application for Social Security disability benefits than control group members.","The authors cautioned that the analysis considered a short time frame—6 to 12 months after enrollment—and therefore might not represent eventual program effects. They also cautioned that the self-reported employment and hours worked measures in the UDS might be imprecise. Finally, the DMIE’s varying, somewhat narrow target populations limit the generalizability of study findings to the working-age adult population.","Honolulu city and county, Hawaii

The study was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that compared outcomes between the treatment and control groups using household surveys conducted before and two years after initial program implementation.
The study found that relative to the control group, children aged 13-15 who participated in the program had significantly larger increases in the hours attending school two years after program implementation began. However, school enrollment rates significantly decreased for children aged 7-12 who participated in the program. There were no significant impacts on child labor.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because randomization was compromised but the authors ensured that the groups being compared were similar before the intervention. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to Program Keluarga Harapan, but other factors might also have contributed.","Absence of Conflict of Interest.","Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH) was a conditional cash transfer program implemented in Indonesia. The program targeted sub-districts that were low-income and had high rates of school dropout. Sub-districts were only selected if there were sufficient education and health services available in the area and if the local government supported the program. Within the selected sub-districts, households were eligible if they were below a poverty cut-off level, had women who were pregnant or lactating, and either had children 0-15 years old or children who were 18 years of age or younger, but with less than 9 years of education. Participating households could receive a quarterly cash transfer that was contingent on household receipt of health care and school-aged children’s school attendance. The local government in the sub-districts implemented the program.","The study was a randomized controlled trial, where 588 eligible sub-districts were randomly assigned to the treatment group receiving PKH (259 sub-districts) or the control group that did not receive any program benefits (329 sub-districts). Within sub-districts, eligible households were selected for the treatment group, but were limited by a quota. The eligible households were part of a predetermined list based on poverty level and household characteristics (e.g., female who was pregnant or lactating, child aged 0-15, child aged 16-18 with less than nine years of education). The participating households were not randomly selected in all of the treatment sub-districts; purposive selection of larger households with less education and fewer assets occurred.
The authors used a baseline survey and a follow-up survey conducted two years after the start of the program to assess study outcomes. Child labor outcomes included participation rates in wage work and the number of hours spent in wage work in the past week and month. School attendance outcomes included the number of hours spent in school in the past week as well as the rates of school enrollment, late enrollment, school participation, attendance, and dropout. The authors randomly selected 180 sub-districts from the treatment group and 180 sub-districts from the control group to participate in the survey. Within each of the sub-districts, eight villages were randomly selected. One rural ward or urban precinct was randomly selected from each village; however, concerns about the number of treated households led to quota sampling for wards and precincts based on the eligibility lists. Additional wards from remaining villages were selected to balance the groups. The analysis sample included 8,298 children aged 7-12 (3,163 in the treatment group and 5,135 in the control group), and 2,449 children aged 13-15 (922 in the treatment group and 1,527 in the control group). The analyses examined differences in labor and schooling outcomes between the control group and the treatment group households that participated in the program. Since there were issues with PKH implementation in 43 sub-districts, the authors also examined differences between the control group and all households eligible for the program (intent-to-treat).","Employment/Child labor
The study did not find significant differences between the treatment group and the control group in participation in paid work in the past week or month.
The study also did not find significant differences the treatment group and the control group in the number of hours spent in paid work in the past week or month.
Education (School participation/enrollment)
For children aged 13-15, the study found that PKH significantly increased school attendance by .7 hours per week. No significant differences were found for rates of school enrollment, late enrollment, school participation, attendance, or dropout.
For children aged 7-12, the study found that PKH significantly decreased the rate of school enrollment by 2.3 percentage points. No significant differences were found for hours attending school per week, rates of late enrollment, school participation, attendance, or dropout.","Random assignment was compromised for this study. After randomly assigning the sub-districts to the treatment or control group, the authors used different procedures in each study group to identify households to participate in the study. In addition, the sample changed between the baseline and follow-up survey, since some children were not eligible to complete questions about child labor and school participation because they were too young to answer these questions when they took the baseline survey, or too old when they took the follow-up survey.","",""

The program was designed to provide an income supplement, reduce school dropout rates, and improve health for children. Three cash transfers were provided to include a food security transfer ($224 USD/year per household), which required monthly health education workshops and well child visits. The second was a school attendance transfer ($112 USD/year per household) requiring school for children ages 7-13, and finally, it included a school supplies transfer ($21 USD) contingent on school enrollment. Each household received the same amount of transfer dollars, regardless of the number of children in the home.","The study was a randomized controlled trial in the Nicaraguan states of Madriz and Matagalpa. In these two states, 21 communities were randomly assigned to receive the intervention (conditional cash transfers) and 21 were randomly assigned to the control group. Communities were chosen based on an index that used information from the 1995 Census. In each community, 42 households were randomly selected using a census that occurred three months before the first evaluation, yielding a treatment group of 882 households and a control group with 882 households. Data were obtained from a baseline (pre-intervention) household survey conducted between August and September 2000, a follow-up household survey in October 2001 (after 11 months of cash transfers), and a final household survey in October 2002 (after 24 months of transfers). The study author examined the effects of the program on eligible children 7 to 13 years of age who had not completed the 4th grade.

The study was a randomized controlled trial with 2,238 participants. The analysis used data from nine surveys administered over the two-year intervention period.
The study found that MHTS had positive impacts on earnings measured 12 and 24 months after random assignment and on health outcomes 24 months after random assignment. There were no statistically significant impacts on disability benefits receipt.
The quality of the evidence presented in this study is moderate for earnings and SSDI benefit receipt outcomes. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the MHTS, but other factors might also have contributed. For the health outcomes, the quality of evidence presented in this study is low. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to MHTS; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The MHTS tested a supported employment intervention. Supported employment interventions use a combination of employment and health services and supports to improve employment and other outcomes for people with psychiatric conditions. The MHTS provided a bundled, comprehensive intervention that combined evidence-based mental health treatments and services with integrated mental health and employment services. The program lasted 24 months and included supportive employment services, systematic medication management, behavioral health services, reimbursement for out-of-pocket behavioral health expenses, and coordinated mental health services. In addition, SSDI medical continuing disability reviews were suspended for three years from the date of program enrollment for those receiving the intervention. After 20 months in the program, participants began a four-month transition process to help return to normal services. Program implementation occurred during 2007 to 2010.","The MHTS was a randomized controlled trial. Across the United States, 23 mental health centers were recruited for the program. Of those, 21 sites were community mental health agencies, one was a vocational center, and one was a housing center that provided vocational services for homeless people with mental illnesses. Within these centers, the Master Beneficiary Record file was used to identify eligible SSDI recipients who (1) were diagnosed with schizophrenia or an affective disorder, (2) were ages 18 to 55, (3) resided within a 30-mile radius of one of the 23 study sites, and (4) volunteered to participate in the study. Those who lived in a nursing home or custodial institution, had a legal guardian, had a life-threatening or terminal health condition, had already received supportive employment services within 30 days of recruitment, or had worked in a competitive job within six months of recruitment were ineligible for random assignment. All eligible, consenting participants were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group. The treatment group was offered MHTS services, whereas the control group received services as usual, along with a comprehensive packet listing services in the community and $100 for completing follow-up surveys. The study randomized 2,238 people, with 1,121 in the treatment group and 1,117 in the control group.
The analysis relied on survey data. Before random assignment, all participants completed a baseline survey. After random assignment, treatment and control group members completed eight surveys over the two-year program period (one every three months). The surveys asked a variety of questions on earnings, sources of income, employment, mental and physical health, and health care utilization.","The estimated impact of the program on earnings was $50.12 in the first year following random assignment and $100 in the second year. Over the full study period, the program significantly increased average formal earnings by $72.35 across all eight quarters of the program.
There was not a statistically significant difference between the treatment and control groups on combined SSDI and Supplemental Security Income receipt over the two-year study period. 
Over the course of two years, the MHTS significantly increased the number of clinic or mental health provider visits and mental health component score, and significantly decreased the number of hospital overnight stays and outpatient psychiatric crisis visits.","Although the study design was a randomized controlled trial, sample attrition was high. This means the study was not eligible for a high causal evidence rating. For the analyses of earnings and SSDI receipt, the authors used 20 control variables in the model, including baseline earnings and employment, age, gender, race, multiple health indicators, and number of months on the SSDI rolls; therefore, these analyses receive a moderate causal evidence rating. However, in the analyses of health outcomes, the authors did not include sufficient controls to receive a moderate evidence rating. In addition, the authors imputed baseline and outcome variables for some of the individuals included in the analysis. Because the study had high attrition, this might bias the results in unknown ways.","",""

Students in the Enhanced Opening Doors program took a college success course that covered personal goals, study skills, and college rules; students also had to attend a student success center for tutoring sessions.
The study was a randomized controlled trial. Eligible students were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which was required to participate in the Enhanced Opening Doors program, or the control group, which was not required to participate in the program. The primary data sources were a baseline survey on the background characteristics of students, students’ transcripts, and degree-attainment information from the National Student Clearinghouse. The study reported outcomes for the four years following random assignment.
The study found that in any of the follow-up years and cumulatively from the first through fourth follow-up years, the program did not have a significant impact on the number of semesters enrolled in college, the number of cumulative credits earned, enrollment in a four-year college, or earning a degree or certificate.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects would be attributable to the Enhanced Opening Doors program, and not to other factors.","","In fall 2006 and spring 2007, Chaffey Community College implemented a mandatory two-semester program called Enhanced Opening Doors. The Enhanced Opening Doors program was built upon an earlier Opening Doors program, which was a one-semester intervention in fall 2005 that included three related components: (1) a voluntary three-credit college success course, taught by a college guidance counselor, which covered personal goals, college rules and regulations, and study skills; (2) visits to the student success center, where students would complete exercises addressing skills and personal learning styles, time management, and test preparation; and (3) the provision of counseling services both during and outside the college success course. The Enhanced Opening Doors program shared the same three core features as the original Opening Doors program, but included three substantial changes. First, Enhanced Opening Doors was expanded to a two-semester intervention that mandated enrollment in the three-credit college success course in the first semester and offered a voluntary success course in the second semester. Second, the Enhanced program required that students complete at least five visits to the student success centers in the first program semester. Third, the counselors who taught the college success course were more experienced than those in the original program, and greater emphasis was placed on the importance of meeting with students outside of class.
To participate in the Enhanced Opening Doors program, students had to be on academic or progress probation, have earned fewer than 35 credits toward a degree or credential, hold a high school degree or general educational development certificate, and be part-time or full-time students ages 18 to 34.","This study was a randomized controlled trial, and randomization occurred at the student level. Eligible students who consented to participate in the study filled out a baseline data form. Then, the students were randomized either to the treatment group, which was required to participate in the Enhanced Opening Doors program, or the control group, which was not required to participate in the program but could access existing college services. There were 444 students randomly assigned, 224 to the treatment group and 220 to the control group.
The authors used data from the baseline data form, students’ transcripts from Chaffey Community College, students’ transcript data from all 112 California community colleges obtained from the California Community College Chancellor’s Office, and the National Student Clearinghouse to measure outcomes related to progress toward degree completion. Impacts were reported as the difference of means between the treatment and control groups, adjusted for the timing of random assignment. This study reported outcomes for three post-program years and cumulatively across the first program year to the end of the third post-program year for a maximum interval of four years following random assignment.","The study found no impacts in any of the post-program years, or cumulatively over the four years following random assignment, on the number of semesters enrolled in college, cumulative credits earned, or enrollment in a four-year college.
The study also found no impacts in any of the post-program years, or cumulatively over the four years following random assignment, on degree or certificate attainment.","The treatment group’s participation in the program was relatively high in the first semester, with 72 percent of the treatment group completing the college success course and 69 percent visiting the success center at least once. However, in the second program semester, participation was much lower. Only 29 percent of the treatment group participated in the optional college success course in the second semester and 29 percent of the treatment group visited the success center at least once. This low participation rate in the second semester might have reduced the potential impact of the program.
The control group members were allowed to sign up for the college success course and visit the success center on their own. Although few control group students actually enrolled in the college success course, about 32 percent of the control group visited the success center at least once in the first semester, compared with 21 percent in the second semester. Because the control group might have also been receiving counseling and tutoring services, the impact of the program could have been dampened.","",""

For this evaluation, 535 students from 10 high schools in Chicago were randomly assigned to the treatment group, which could enroll in ASM, or the control group, which could not. Outcome data were derived from high school records from both semesters of the academic year of study participation and a mock job interview at the end of the spring semester of the same year.
The study reported no statistically significant impacts of participation in ASM on high school grade point average (GPA), number of classes failed, school absences, or likelihood of being hired for a permanent or summer entry-level position.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this report is high for all academic outcomes. This means we are confident that estimated impacts for these outcomes would be solely attributable to ASM, and not other factors. For the likelihood of employment outcomes, the quality of evidence is moderate. This means we have confidence that the effects estimated in this study would be attributable at least in part to the ASM program, though other factors could also have contributed.","","ASM offered paid after-school apprenticeships in a variety of fields, including computer refurbishment, journalism, clothing design, storytelling, web design, claymation, dance and percussion, sports, songwriting, photography, painting and drawing, and the culinary arts. The program consisted of a 10-week apprenticeship during both the fall and spring semesters, so the intervention lasted 20 weeks over one academic year. Most apprenticeships took place within the high school building and met for three hours, three times a week (for a total of nine hours per week). Students who participated in at least 73 percent of the sessions were paid $900.
Two paid instructors led youth in each apprenticeship. The instructors were not typically teachers but made their living in the field of the apprenticeship. For the evaluation, strong instructors were selected by ASM program staff; all instructors in the evaluation had worked for at least a year on ASM before the evaluation.
Youth were eligible for the program if they had not completed the same apprenticeship in the previous year (youth who had participated in a different apprenticeship or ASM program previously were still eligible) and if the instructors judged them to be acceptable for the program.","Students who expressed interest in the program, completed parental consent, and received instructor approval were randomly assigned to either the treatment or the control group. The treatment group was allowed to participate in the ASM program, whereas the control group was not. Data for the education and employment outcomes were collected for all students from high school records and a mock job interview. In the mock job interviews, two human resources professionals interviewed participants for one of two hypothetical summer jobs. The interviewers rated the likelihood they would recommend hiring the participant for either an entry-level summer or permanent position.","The ASM had no impact on high school GPA, school absences, number of failed courses, or likelihood of being hired for a permanent or summer entry-level position.","Nearly 47 percent of students assigned to the treatment group dropped out of their apprenticeship before program completion. In addition, students in the control group were free to seek existing after-school programs in the community. Before the evaluation, it was assumed that few other programs were available for youth in the control group. However, 91 percent participated in some sort of organized after-school activity or paid work. Therefore, the comparison of the treatment and control groups measures the impact of ASM compared with the other available programming in which students in the control group participated.
The programs chosen by the authors to participate in this evaluation had strong experience in previously implementing ASM apprenticeships. Although chosen for their high quality, however, 3 of the 13 apprenticeship programs did not meet the authors’ expectations for quality.
Finally, the employment-related outcomes suffered from high attrition, so they are not eligible for a high causal evidence rating. However, the authors included sufficient control variables in their models to receive a moderate evidence rating.","",""

In the analyses for rural areas, the study found that the receipt of the RdO was significantly associated with a decrease in child labor by 6.2 percentage points and an increase in school enrollment by 8.8 percentage points. In the analyses for the indigenous areas, the receipt of RdO was significantly associated with an increase in school enrollment by 6.3 percentage points, but not related to child labor.

The program targeted the poorest households in all areas of Panama. Household eligibility was estimated by examining socioeconomic variables to predict the likelihood that a household was impoverished. The thresholds used to determine inclusion varied by region and were as follows: for urban households the criteria was a probability of being poor at 35 percent or higher; for rural households, the criteria was a probability of being poor at 25 percent or higher; and for indigenous households, the criteria was a probability of being poor at 20 percent or higher. The cash transfer was delivered bimonthly to eligible households at a rate of $70 USD. When households did not comply with the conditions of the program, the bimonthly payment was reduced to $20 USD per month. In 2008, the bimonthly payment increased to $100 USD. Compliance was monitored by self-report and the conditions included: children being enrolled in school 80 percent of the time, children under 5 and pregnant women in the household receiving health care, and one adult in the household attending an information session on human development every 6 months.","Data were drawn from the 2008 Living Standards Measurement Survey. The authors used propensity score matching to compare the treatment group to the comparison group on several outcomes, including child labor (if the child worked in the previous week) and school enrollment (if the child was enrolled in formal schooling). The analysis was completed separately for (1) indigenous individuals residing in independent areas, and (2) non-indigenous individuals residing in rural areas. The majority of the population in both areas live in poverty.
The treatment and comparison groups were formed by their receipt of the conditional cash transfers (CCTs) via RdO. Those that received the CCTs were considered the treatment group. The comparison group included households that did not receive the CCTs. The groups were matched on household characteristics (e.g., household has adequate roofing; household has potable water). Importantly, the government used fridge ownership as a criterion to target RdO to households; this variable was not used in the propensity score matching.
Households with children aged 4- to 17-years of age were included in the study, the age group eligible for RdO. There were 1,203 households in the treatment condition, and 5,730 in the comparison condition. The analyses examining labor activities included a subsample of the households with children aged 10-17.","Employment/Child labor
In the analyses examining the data in rural areas, the study found a statistically significant relationship as the receipt of RdO decreased the likelihood of a child working by 6.2 percentage points.
In the analyses for the indigenous areas, the receipt of RdO was not significantly associated with child labor.
Education (School participation/enrollment)
In the analyses examining the data in rural areas, the study found a statistically significant relationship as the receipt of RdO increased the children's enrollment in formal schooling by 8.8 percentage points.
In the analyses for the indigenous areas, the receipt of RdO significantly increased enrollment in formal schooling by 6.3 percentage points.","The authors did not account for other factors that could have affected the difference between the treatment and comparison group, as they did not match on some of the required controls (age, gender, baseline child labor, baseline school enrollment), and they were not used as controls in their models.
The authors also discuss that there may be issues with supply of middle and high schools. The authors attempt to address the issue by reanalyzing the data where propensity score matching was conducted with region/area as a matching criterion. The authors report that the findings held; however, they note that the method they use does not address how geographic barriers impact school access. Moreover, the authors note that compliance was verified by self-report and that the self-report indices were verified by an annual stamp received from teachers.","",""

Students with eight declared majors could participate in a career-focused learning community, which involved enrolling in three linked courses during a semester: two required courses for the student’s major and an integrative seminar designed to reinforce the two required courses and raise awareness of career options. 
The study was a randomized controlled trial. Eligible students were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which was offered the opportunity to participate in one of the learning communities, or the control group, which was not allowed to enroll in a learning community. The primary data sources were a baseline survey on background characteristics of students and student transcripts.
The study found no significant impacts on registration in any course, number of semesters registered, credits earned or attempted, the proportion of students who passed or withdrew from all classes, grade point average (GPA), or graduation rate in either the semester of program implementation or the first post-program semester.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects would be attributable to the learning communities, and not to other factors.","","At Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn, New York, the career-focused learning communities program involved enrolling small cohorts of students in three linked courses during one semester. Two of the courses were required for a specific major, and the third was a seminar designed to reinforce the learning objectives of the other two courses and provide students practical information about careers in their selected majors. By having small groups of up to 25 students take classes together, the career-focused learning communities aimed to create social and academic networks for students, and to encourage engagement and persistence in school. The program took place in five different semesters, from fall 2007 to fall 2009. For the fall 2007, spring 2008, and fall 2008 semesters, the program was offered for five majors: allied health, accounting, business administration, childhood education, and mental health. Because of low enrollment in those five learning communities, the school expanded the program to two additional majors in the spring 2009 semester: liberal arts and tourism and hospitality, and added a learning community for criminal justice majors in fall 2009. Although the number of learning communities varied in any given semester due to student enrollment, in total, there were 32 career-focused learning communities across the eight majors and five semester cohorts. To be eligible for the career-focused learning communities, students had to have already fulfilled most of their developmental education requirements, be in at least their second semester of college, and have declared one of the majors included in the program.","This study was a randomized controlled trial. Randomization occurred at the student level, separately for each semester cohort. Eligible students who provided consent to participate in the study filled out a baseline data form. Then, the students were randomized either to the treatment group, which was offered the opportunity to enroll in a learning community, or the control group, which could not enroll in a learning community, but could access existing college services. There were 917 students in the study, with 537 in the treatment group and 380 in the control group.
The authors used data from students’ transcripts and the baseline data form to report the mean outcomes for the two groups. The authors weighted the outcome means to account for a student’s cohort, different random assignment ratios within cohorts, and declared major at baseline. The authors reported outcomes for two time periods: the program semester and the first post-program semester.","The study found no significant impacts on registration in any course, the number of semesters registered, credits earned or attempted, the proportion of students who passed all classes or withdrew from all classes, GPA, or the graduation rate in either the semester of program implementation or the first post-program semester.","The authors noted two concerns with implementation that might explain why the program had no impacts. First, the career-focused learning communities had small class sizes—averaging 15 students—which instructors felt made project-based learning and group discussion more challenging. Only 2 of the 32 learning communities in the study were actually enrolled at or above the targeted number of 25 students per learning community. Second, a sizable portion of the instructors in the career-focused learning community classes were new to the model. For example, 7 of the 18 instructors in spring 2008 were new to the learning communities program. The authors suggested that the career-focused learning community model can take up to two years to learn and master, so having these new teachers deliver the program could be a concern for implementation fidelity.
The authors also noted that the control group’s experience might not have differed greatly from that of the treatment group. First, many control students engaged in so-called de facto cohorting; because there were very few classes available in certain majors, students often took multiple classes with the same group of classmates. Even though this arrangement was not as formal as the linked courses within the learning community, control group students might have created networks of classmates that were similar to those of the treatment group. In addition, the authors noted that many control group members had the same instructors as the treatment group, although outside the learning communities linked courses. Some of these instructors reported using the same strategies to engage students and integrate content in all their courses, both inside and outside the learning communities. Finally, both treatment and control group members had access to quite extensive existing services at Kingsborough, and appeared to have used these services at comparable rates. Consequently, the authors argued that the experiences of treatment and control group members might have been quite similar, making large impacts of learning communities less likely.","",""

The program sought to maximize economic self-sufficiency and independence for youth disability insurance beneficiaries by improving their employment and educational opportunities. The program targeted youth ages 14 through 18 who received Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and resided in Bronx County.
The study examined implementation of YTDP at two CUNY campuses, focusing on major aspects of service delivery, including the background, local context, and service environment of YTDP. It also provided information on beneficiaries’ characteristics and satisfaction with the program. The study used qualitative analysis of staff and beneficiary interviews, including data collected from site visits; and descriptive quantitative analysis of beneficiaries’ baseline and follow-up survey data and service utilization data from a management information system.
The study found that youth beneficiaries had access to all of the services in the conceptual framework. Many began receiving individualized services before participating in structured workshops. However, education-related and person-centered services were among the less-intensive service offerings.
Study findings related to implementation challenges and solutions are potentially applicable to other current or future projects that provide employment-related services to youth with disabilities.","","The YTDP in Bronx, New York, was one of six project sites using a randomized design as part of the larger Social Security Administration-sponsored the YTD, which intended to help youth with disabilities become more self-sufficient and improve their employment outcomes. From 2006 to 2010, CUNY’s John F. Kennedy, Jr. Institute for Worker Education implemented the YTDP project to SSI beneficiaries ages 14 to 19 with severe disabilities. YTDP provided events and information to engage parents and family members; group activities, workshops, and benefits counseling; and individualized employment services. A guaranteed summer job was a key component of the program.
All YTD participants were also eligible for waivers that (1) extended the student earned income exclusion to all YTD participants who attended school regardless of age, (2) increased the earned income exclusion to a $1 reduction in SSI benefit for every $4 earned above a base amount, and (3) delayed benefit cessation for YTD participants determined ineligible for benefits after a benefit review or age-18 SSI medical redetermination. The curriculum-based program began in early October of each year for a new cohort of enrollees. The core curriculum, which consisted of workshops held on Saturdays, lasted 11 months, after which beneficiaries would have to seek follow-up services proactively.","The implementation portion of the study sought to describe whether the demonstration, as implemented by CUNY, tested the service intervention as conceived by the Social Security Administration. In doing so, the study described the major aspects of implementation, including the local context; inputs, resources, and partnerships; service delivery, including dosage; and beneficiaries’ characteristics and satisfaction with program services. The implementation study drew on program documents, site visits, interviews with managers and staff, focus groups with beneficiaries and parents, telephone interviews with staff, and service provision data from the evaluation’s management information system. The study included both CUNY campuses that implemented YTDP and was conducted from August 2007 through August 2009, with site visits conducted each year.","The study found that CUNY implemented the YTD model as designed. Beneficiaries had access to all of the services in the conceptual framework, including benefits counseling, person-centered planning, and structured workshops. However, the study found that the core service delivery model of 11 months was shorter than intended in the conceptual framework, and that summer work experience was limited, both in duration and in the ability of counselors to match beneficiaries to appropriate work activities.
The program operated in a challenging context, but compensated for some of these challenges through leveraging resources and employing a strong staff. The Bronx constituted an economically depressed environment, and although an array of services existed for youth with disabilities, these services were found to be duplicative, fractured, inadequately staffed and funded, and difficult to access. To implement YTDP, the grantee was able to leverage CUNY facilities and a grant to provide benefits counseling, and relied heavily on part-time and temporary staff. The study found that staff were demographically representative of and had experience with the target population, and were personally invested in the program. There was little turnover and staff were retained and promoted throughout the life of the program.
CUNY YTDP was able to offer at least one service to all 387 enrolled beneficiaries. Of these, 87 percent attended at least one workshop and, on average, beneficiaries attended at least 9 workshops, with nearly 25 percent attending 16 or more workshops. Further, 93 percent received a benefits planning service and 60 percent attended a person-centered planning session. Nearly all (99 percent) received case management services, 92 percent received an employment-related service, about half participated in summer employment, and 70 percent received an education-related service. Despite the core service model being shorter in duration than intended, most beneficiaries found the program to be meaningful. Staff reported that they thought youth would have benefitted from more structured, proactive assistance in finding longer-term employment.","The study clearly identified the research question and topics of interest and explored an array of data sources to explore these topics. It included a systematic description of findings and effectively illustrated findings with case studies, quotes from interviews and focus groups, and descriptive quantitative management information system and survey data. Qualitative and quantitative data were triangulated, but the study did not include a thorough description of data collection, data analysis, and data quality control. The study findings are potentially applicable to other current or future projects that provide employment-related services to youth with disabilities; however, the absence of information on methods and analysis makes it difficult to determine the extent to which the findings reflect the average program experience.","",""

The study used a randomized controlled trial to assign female students majoring in a discipline other than computer science to meet with one of four different types of upper-level students who varied by gender and whether they embodied perceived stereotypes of computer science majors. The authors administered a questionnaire to estimate impacts of the different intervention conditions.
The study found that women who interacted with a stereotypical computer science role model believed they would be less successful as a computer science major compared with women who interacted with a nonstereotypical computer science role model and with women who did not interact with a role model.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is low because the study had high attrition and the authors did not demonstrate baseline equivalence between the samples or include adequate controls to ensure the resulting groups were similar on all relevant characteristics. This means we are not confident that the effects estimated in this study are attributable to role model interaction; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","","This randomized controlled trial assigned 85 female undergraduates with a major other than computer science to meet with one of four different types of upper-level students intended to serve as role models: (1) male stereotypical computer science majors, (2) female stereotypical computer science majors, (3) male nonstereotypical computer science majors, or (4) female nonstereotypical computer science majors. Before conducting the experiment, the authors developed these prototypes using results from an undergraduate survey asking about styles of dress; hobbies; and preferences for television, movies, and magazines associated with computer science majors versus typical college students. The authors recruited upper-level students to pose as role models embodying these stereotypes for the purpose of the experiment. A fifth group of study participants was randomly assigned to the control group; they were told that their assigned role model was unable to attend the meeting as planned.
After interacting with their role models (or not, in the case of the control group), study participants answered two questions about their expected performance if they were to major in the same field as their role models. The authors used analysis of variance to estimate differences in attitudes across the various study conditions.","The study found that women who interacted with a role model embodying computer science stereotypes expected to be less successful in computer science than women who interacted with a nonstereotypical computer science role model.
Women who interacted with the stereotypical computer science role model expressed lower success beliefs than women who did not interact with any role model.
There was no difference between the nonstereotypical treatment group and the control group, and no difference by role model gender.","The authors did not provide sample assignment or attrition information by study condition to enable CLEAR to calculate differential attrition rates; however, they did report overall attrition. CLEAR estimated worst-case-scenario differential attrition by attributing all study attrition to one condition or the other, which resulted in high differential attrition in either case. Although the study was a randomized controlled trial by design, the high attrition made it ineligible to receive a high causal evidence rating; thus, it was treated as a nonexperimental design for this review. The authors did not demonstrate baseline equivalence between the samples or include the control variables required by the protocol for nonexperimental designs, so the study could not receive a moderate causal evidence rating either.","",""

Report submitted to the Social Security Administration.","The study’s objective was to examine the implementation and impact of the Mental Health Treatment Study, which provided individual placement and support (IPS, an evidence-based model of supported employment services) and systematic medication management to Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) recipients with psychiatric disabilities. This profile focuses on the implementation study; see CLEAR’s profile of the impact study here.
The implementation study focused on fidelity to the program model, consistency in service delivery, where services occurred, and the relationship between fidelity and employment rates. The authors collected data from regular telephone calls with program staff, site visits, participants’ medical records, follow-up interviews, and service use data. To measure fidelity, the study used a 15-point IPS fidelity scale; each scale item reflected a specific element in the IPS practice.
Overall, the study found that 77 percent of sites achieved high fidelity in the first year of implementation and 86 percent of sites achieved high fidelity in the second and third years. More than 90 percent of participants engaged in some type of supported employment service in the first reporting period and almost 90 percent did so in the second reporting period.
Study findings related to implementation challenges and solutions are potentially applicable to other current or future projects that provide employment-related services to people with psychiatric disabilities.","","The Mental Health Treatment Study tested an IPS supported employment intervention coupled with systematic medication management. Supported employment models provide a combination of employment and health services and supports to improve employment and other outcomes for people with psychiatric conditions. Programs in the study provided a bundled, comprehensive intervention that combined evidence-based mental health treatments and services with integrated employment services. The program lasted 24 months and included supportive employment services, systematic medication management, behavioral health services, reimbursement for out-of-pocket behavioral health expenses, and coordinated mental health services. In addition, SSDI medical continuing disability reviews were suspended for three years from the date of program enrollment for those receiving the intervention. After 20 months in the program, participants began a four-month transition process to help return to normal services. Program implementation occurred from 2006 to 2010.","The implementation portion of the study sought to describe the extent to which the 23 participating sites implemented the service intervention as intended. In doing so, the study described the major aspects of implementation, including contextual factors, planning, and design; inputs and resources, including staffing; and service delivery, including engagement with services and dosage. The study drew on data from weekly telephone calls (intended to provide ongoing feedback and technical assistance) with program staff, two site visits, participant medical records, follow-up interviews with participants, and service use data from a quality management template completed by program staff. The study was conducted from November 2006 through July 2010, with site visits occurring in January 2008 and January 2009.","Context, planning, and design. The study operated in a challenging economy. Most sites faced severe financial stress due to the economic recession and state funding cutbacks, and two sites ceased recruitment and enrollment activities within the first year. Despite these challenges, the community mental health centers recruited for the study were already familiar with the supported employment model, able to start operations quickly, and negotiated with other agencies for the provision of services the centers could not provide directly. The characteristics of some participants also presented challenges to the program design. For instance, program staff noted a considerable lack of engagement on the part of unemployed participants and found that some participants were too disabled to wait for services at the centers. Physical health impairments and substance abuse problems among participants also posed great difficulties to efforts to increase employability of participants.
Inputs and resources. Each study site employed a nurse care coordinator who supported systematic medication management and medical and psychiatric care; a supported employment specialist, who focused on providing employment supports; and a research assistant, who recruited and enrolled participants and administered post-baseline participant interviews. The study also employed quality management program directors to provide ongoing technical assistance and feedback to sites to promote adherence to the IPS model.
Service delivery and engagement. Engagement with different types of services varied widely across sites. On average, more than 90 percent of participants completed vocational plans and assessments; 69 percent received some form of benefits counseling; 54 percent received case management; 53 percent received general medical care; and fewer than a quarter received social skills training, financial assistance, housing assistance, substance abuse treatment, family counseling, or legal assistance. The study found the lack of some of these behavioral support services (particularly case management) and the inability to offer services in-house to be an implementation challenge. However, program staff sometimes took on the case management role if it was not otherwise available. Participants’ contact with their supported employment specialists and employers declined over time.
More than 90 percent of participants engaged with the systematic medication management component of the intervention and 57 percent were always engaged. More than 93 percent of participants reported that they took their medicine as prescribed most of the time and during the final follow-up interview; more than two-thirds expressed a positive attitude toward the use of psychotropic medications to control their symptoms. The off-site location of many medication prescribers presented difficulties in integrating this component with the rest of the intervention, but implementing staff filled in gaps on prescribers’ reports or aggressively pursued prescribers to supply these data.
Fidelity to the program model. The study found that the sites generally implemented the supported employment model with fidelity, with 77 percent of them achieving high fidelity in the first year and 86 percent of them achieving high fidelity in the second and third years. Overall, fidelity ratings averaged 67.6 in Year 1, 69.3 in Year 2, and 67.2 in Year 3, out of a total possible score of 75, based on a 15-point IPS fidelity scale in which each scale item reflected a specific element in the supported employment intervention. However, among the program participants, fidelity ratings did not seem to be associated with higher employment rates (as reported by the participants themselves).","The study clearly described how it derived fidelity and implementation measures, and it illustrated findings with descriptive quantitative service receipt data. The study would have benefited from including a more thorough description of on-site data collection. In addition, for the study the authors selected from among 50 sites that were already using an IPS model; they chose not to do random selection through a nationally representative probability sample because of the need for quick start-up with all program components in place. Although the authors suggested that the sites were selected to support generalizability of the findings, it is unclear to what extent the study findings would apply to future projects that provide employment-related services to people with psychiatric disabilities.","",""

Earlier reports examined outcomes at 9 and 21 months.
The program’s effectiveness was evaluated using a randomized controlled trial conducted in 10 states. This report examined the effects of the program on participants’ educational attainment, earnings, employment, and other outcomes measured through a survey conducted about three years after participants entered the study.
The study found statistically significant, positive impacts of the ChalleNGe program on employment, earnings, education, and training outcomes measured after three years.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is high because it is a well-conducted randomized controlled trial. This means we have confidence that the effects estimated in this study are attributable to the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe program.","","The National Guard Youth ChalleNGe program began in the early 1990s with a mission to target at-risk youth and equip them with the skills and training to have successful adult lives. To be eligible, youth must be 16 to 18 years of age, have dropped out of or been expelled from school, be unemployed, not be drug users, and not be heavily involved in the criminal justice system.
The 17-month program consists of a two-week Pre-Challenge phase, a 20-week Residential phase, and a one-year Post-Residential phase. Participants live in barracks-style housing (sometimes on a military base) in a very disciplined environment during the first two phases. They wear their hair short, are referred to as cadets, and wear military uniforms. In the Pre-Challenge phase, participants are oriented to the program’s rules and begin physical training. During the Residential phase, they participate in a number of different activities addressing eight core pillars: leadership/followership, responsible citizenship, service to community, life-coping skills, physical fitness, health and hygiene, job skills, and academic excellence. Most of their time is spent in an educational component that is usually geared toward receiving a General Educational Development (GED). During the Post-Residential phase of the program, after participants are placed in employment, education, or military service, they receive structured mentoring.","The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted at 10 program sites in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Texas, and Wisconsin. In 2005 and 2006, about 3,000 eligible applicants were randomly assigned to either receive an offer to participate in the program (the treatment group) or to not receive an offer for the program in the current or future application cycles (the control group). For the three-year survey, the authors attempted to survey a subsample of those originally randomly assigned (916 treatment and 592 control youth). To estimate the effectiveness of the ChalleNGe program, the authors compared the outcomes of the treatment group with outcomes of the control group.
This study examined the effects of the ChalleNGe program on education, employment, and training outcomes, relative to the effects of other employment and training programs used by control group youth, measured about three years after random assignment. The study also examined outcomes on military enlistment, delinquency and criminal activity, health, sexual activity, and substance use.","The authors reported statistically significant, positive impacts of the ChalleNGe program on earning a high school diploma and/or a GED certificate, earning any college credit, enrolling in college courses at the time of the follow-up survey, and receiving vocational training.
One notably large impact was on the percentage of youth who had earned a high school diploma and/or GED: 72 percent of youth admitted to the ChalleNGe program, compared with 56 percent of control youth.
The authors also reported statistically significant, positive impacts of the ChalleNGe program on five of the ten employment or earnings outcomes examined. One notable impact was that youth admitted to the ChalleNGe program had average earnings in the past 12 months of about $13,500, compared with an average of $11,250 among the control group.
Other positive and statistically significant impacts of ChalleNGe were reported on the number of months employed in the previous 12 months, the percentage employed at the time of survey administration, the current average weekly earnings, the percentage currently working full-time, the percentage with an hourly wage under $6, and the percentage with an hourly wage of $10 or more.","Not all youth who were randomly assigned to receive an offer to participate in the program did ultimately participate. However, youth are included in the treatment group regardless of whether they successfully completed the program. This could reduce the estimated impact of the program.
The authors estimated multiple related impacts on education, employment, and earnings. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. CLEAR performed statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests and the results remained statistically significant.","",""

The study examined pilot procedures and potential challenges for national implementation of the Benefit Offset National Demonstration (BOND), which intended to reduce barriers confronting SSDI recipients wishing to increase their earnings by offering a benefit offset.
The study focused on how to effectively implement and administer the benefit offset and whether work incentives counseling and other employment supports would encourage beneficiaries to take advantage of the offset program. The authors used administrative data about recruitment and service use, focus groups, and surveys.
The study found that recruitment for the demonstration was challenging because of perceived threats to benefits status from participating. Effective communication through multiple modes was crucial to successful recruitment. In addition, staff found the start and end dates of benefits changes difficult to communicate to participants, and so developed tools, including time lines, to do so.
Due to limitations in the study’s discussions of its research methods, it is unclear whether findings are potentially applicable to other projects for SSDI beneficiaries.","","Administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA), the BOPD was a pilot test of the later BOND. The primary intervention was a benefit offset that replaced the so-called cash cliff that SSDI recipients who work eventually experience. The cash cliff refers to the fact that Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) recipients who have completed a nine-month trial work period (TWP) followed by a three-month grace period have all their SSDI benefits suspended or terminated if they earn more than a threshold amount known as substantial gainful activity (SGA). The benefit offset replaces the complete loss of all benefits for working SSDI recipients, instead gradually withdrawing the SSDI benefit by $1 for every $2 earned above the SGA amount. SSA discontinued benefit offset eligibility for BOPD treatment subjects who had not completed a TWP by December 31, 2008, which was two years earlier than BOPD treatment subjects had initially been told their benefit offset eligibility would expire.
BOPD was implemented in four states: Connecticut, Utah, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Apart from recruiting SSDI recipients who received benefits solely based on their own earnings records, had completed a TWP within the past 72 months, and were not concurrently receiving SSI benefits, the states were free to select their own program eligibility criteria. Utah recruited potential participants statewide from the disability Medicaid program, the SSA benefits counseling program, the vocational rehabilitation program, and two community mental health programs. Of the 11,350 Utah residents contacted to participate in the BOPD, 1,495 responded to the initial solicitation. Ultimately, 503 were found eligible, consented to participate, and were enrolled in the pilot.","The implementation portion of the study sought to evaluate procedures in obtaining participants’ consent and retaining participants, and assess challenges in providing employment supports to participants. The study described major aspects of inputs, resources, collaboration between partners, recruitment and enrollment processes, and service delivery. The study drew on administrative data on recruitment and service use, surveys, and focus group data. The pilot began in August 2005 and study participants enrolled from August 22, 2005, to October 31, 2006. This profile focuses on the implementation of BOPD in Utah; implementation results were not presented for the other states.","The Utah BOPD was implemented by the public vocational rehabilitation agency, the Medicaid agency, the state workforce agency, and two community mental health agencies (one in a rural area and one in an urban area). The agencies identified and recruited SSDI beneficiaries from their program rolls, provided services that would support work efforts, and collected administrative service data. SSA did not make lists of SSDI beneficiaries’ names available, and this lack of data on SSDI status resulted in an inefficient enrollment process.
Demonstration staff enrolled participants into the study and provided benefits counseling. They also made referrals for other supports such as vocational rehabilitation services, Medicaid, and mental health providers. Vocational rehabilitation services included creating an individualized plan based on an employment goal, completing a vocational assessment, career counseling, education and job training, medical rehabilitation, and job placement. If a participant appeared to be eligible for Medicaid, a referral was made to the state’s Medicaid Buy-In program, which allowed disabled people whose incomes exceeded the usual eligibility limit to pay a monthly premium to access Medicaid. In doing so, the program aimed to remove the disincentive for low-income beneficiaries to work. Mental health providers offered case management, job coaching, and work opportunities for individuals diagnosed as having serious, persistent mental illness.
Lessons learned from the pilot demonstration included the following:
The pilot study found that beneficiaries and their families were anxious when approached about going to work or participating in a program that they perceived could jeopardize their benefits status; because beneficiaries had previously affirmed their inability to work when applying for SSDI, they might have been wary to then participate in a program that encouraged them to work (although the demonstration did not show this). To address this concern, demonstration staff modified their recruitment strategy halfway through the recruitment period to offer a more personal approach from counselors or others who already had relationships with the people being recruited. This approach was successful at increasing enrollment.
The demonstration staff initially faced challenges explaining the demonstration to potential participants, obtaining informed consent, and providing services. To address these challenges, staff developed a variety of communication techniques, including one-on-one meetings, brochures, slide presentations, and diagrams, to better explain the demonstration. They also developed plain language materials and modified resources for use with participants who had visual or hearing/speech impairments.
It was difficult to plan or know with certainty when participants would begin to receive benefit offsets. To determine whether beneficiaries had used up their TWP, SSA conducted a continuing disability review to verify employment status, wages, and subsidies. The time to complete this process varied, and because of this uncertain timing, beneficiaries could not know in advance when they would be eligible for the offset. To address this uncertainty, demonstration staff stayed in close contact with the participants to alert them to milestones and provided them with a time line to help monitor receipt of the offset.","The study clearly identified the research questions and stated that it used service use data to explore these topics. However, it did not explain how it used survey and focus group data, despite including descriptive information on how the pilot was implemented, such as challenges and modifications during implementation. The study did a good job presenting enrollment data, but did not include participation data. The study would have benefited from a more thorough description of its sources, data collection techniques, analysis methods, and data quality control techniques, especially regarding survey and focus group data collection. Without this information, it is unclear whether findings are potentially applicable to other projects for SSDI beneficiaries.","",""

The authors used data from the United States Federal Reserve’s triennial Survey of Consumer Finance to estimate ordinary least squares (OLS) and instrumental variable (IV) regression models. Both models control for demographic characteristics and financial situation.
The authors found that having a borrowing option significantly increased both contribution rates and debt.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the borrowing option in DC pension plans. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","","","Being able to borrow from DC plan balances significantly increased contribution rates by 1.4 percentage points. In addition, those with a borrowing option had 41 percent higher total real debt compared with others with a DC plan, a statistically significant difference.
Wealth maximizers (but not nonwealth maximizers) able to borrow from DC plan balances increased their contributions by 3.7 percentage points, which was statistically significant.","The Survey of Consumer Finance often has missing responses to the question about the availability of a borrowing option in a DC plan. The authors imputed responses to this question when the data were missing. The authors did not report the number of respondents with imputed data. However, they noted that many people did not answer this question, likely because they were not familiar enough with their retirement plan to answer definitively. Hence, the data imputation might be problematic because the data were likely not missing at random. That is, those who were more likely to use the borrowing option were more likely to know whether they had access to such an option.
The authors did not provide any information about the firms that did or did not offer borrowing against DC plans. There might be some key (observed or unobserved) differences between firms that select this option and those that do not. It seems plausible that firms that offer this option might also have additional pension plan options. This means there is a potential selection issue, and the authors did not adjust for this selection mechanism in the OLS regression.
The authors did not include a test of the instruments’ strength in their analysis of the IV model. In addition, the instruments used in the analysis might affect the outcomes of interest in multiple ways—not just via the endogenous variable—and therefore be invalid.","",""

The study was a randomized controlled trial examining DMIE’s impacts on earnings, benefits applications, and activities of daily living (ADLs). Data sources included participant surveys and health care and employment service utilization information. Impacts were evaluated 12 months after sample members’ enrollment.

This means that we cannot be confident that the estimated effects are attributable to Minnesota’s DMIE; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The DMIE, which was authorized under the 1999 Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act and funded by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, aimed to delay or prevent reliance on Social Security disability benefits through medical assistance and other supports.

The study randomly assigned 1,557 volunteer participants: 1,257 to the treatment group, which could receive SWSW services, and 300 to the control group.
Data for the analysis were drawn from multiple sources, including participant surveys administered by mail at baseline and 12 months after enrollment and health care and employment service utilization data from the Minnesota Medicaid Management Information System.

This study used three experiments in a controlled setting to examine undergraduate students’ intuitions of retirement savings growth, understanding of investment concepts, and motivation to invest toward their retirement after entering the workforce.1
The authors administered three surveys consisting of hypothetical situations followed by exercises asking respondents to compute an omitted element of the savings function (for example, the monthly deposit amount or rate of return required to accumulate a given amount of savings at retirement). Each experiment randomly assigned participants to receive or not receive some form of aid (for example, a calculator) or additional information (for example, savings growth charts) to complete the exercises.
The first study found that participants tended to severely underestimate projected savings account balances at retirement and overestimate the rates of return and monthly deposit amounts required to ensure such balances. The second study found that when provided with information on exponential growth, participants were more motivated to save for retirement; however, in the third study there was no statistically significant relationship between information on exponential growth and motivation to save for retirement.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this portion of the study is high. This means we are confident that any differences in responses were a result of the various treatment conditions of the three experiments.
Analysis of Employees’ Survey Data
The study further aimed to determine whether showing employees how much money they would have at retirement—based on current annual contributions, the current account balance, and return rates—can motivate them to increase savings, compared with showing employees current account balances only.
The authors analyzed differences in employees’ interest in changing current levels of retirement savings, measured on a seven-point Likert scale, comparing those who were provided only their estimated 401(k) account balance at retirement and those who were shown only their current balance.
The analysis demonstrated that showing workers actual account projections (in addition to the current balance) motivated them to save more.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this portion of the study is also high. This means we are confident that showing employees their estimated 401(k) account balances at retirement increased the percentage of employees who wanted to save more each month.","","","","The experiments with undergraduate participants suggested that providing information on exponential growth can lead people to want to save more. 
In the experiment with working participants, a significantly higher percentage of those in the experimental group expressed increased interest in saving more for retirement post-intervention than in the control group (41 versus 27 percent, respectively).","This study was a well-conducted randomized controlled trial with no attrition. There is no reason to believe that there were any systematic differences between the treatment and control groups. Additionally, although the authors did not report such output, they indicated there were no significant differences in relevant covariates (for example, gender, age, tenure, and salary) between the treatment and control groups for Experiment 4. Thus, there are no apparent confounds that could lead to biases in the results.
The results using data collected from undergraduate students must be interpreted with caution because the actions and opinions of these students might not reflect those of employed people who are saving for retirement (the population of interest for this topic area). In addition, all results in this study should be interpreted carefully because the outcomes analyzed relate to hypothetical, not actual, savings behavior. That is, the authors did not determine whether people acted upon their stated intensions to change behavior.","","1An additional experiment was included in the study (called Experiment 2) but is not of interest to this review."

That is, if the relative employment rates of whites and African Americans in Washington were evolving differently than those for the rest of the country before I-200, the estimated impacts could represent the effects of historical trends rather than the effect of the affirmative action repeal.
In addition, the author estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to employment. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The author did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in this domain is likely to be overstated.","",""

The authors estimated regression models using data from a longitudinal survey conducted online, which followed the same students from freshman to senior year, to analyze factors significantly associated with (1) the students’ intentions to stay in the engineering field in five years and (2) the students’ actual persistence in the field over the course of the survey period.
The study found that male students were more likely to stay in their engineering major over the course of the study, as well as to stay in the engineering field at higher rates than the female students. However, the study found no significant association between plans for a family and women leaving the engineering major. Likewise, the study did not find a significant association between self-assessment of math skills and persistence in the engineering field for women.
The authors generated a measure of professional role confidence, which included both an assessment of one’s own expertise and skills needed for engineering jobs and a self-assessment of how well the engineering field fits the individual’s career plans. The study found that the professional role confidence measure was significantly associated with persistence in the engineering field. The professional role confidence measure varied significantly by gender, however, with men having higher confidence measures; the authors suggested that professional role confidence might help explain the differing persistence levels between men and women in engineering.","","","","","","",""

In 2005, they began a new social assistance program called the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP). The Agricultural Extension Support Program (AEP) was an additional program offered that was around before and during PSNP implementation. AEP provides technical assistance on farming practices, farming support, and access to advanced technologies and fertilizer. The AEP program was available to all local farmers with no restrictions, which applied to most of the PSNP program participants.","The author used a nonexperimental design to compare the labor and schooling outcomes of children in households that participated in the AEP with those who did not, using data from the 2006 Young Lives survey. The Young Lives survey provided data on how much time youth spend in different activities, including schooling and paid work. It also asked about household demographics and participation in social programs since 2002; this information was used to identify participants for the treatment and comparison groups. The author created a matched comparison group based on child and household socioeconomic characteristics. The study included only children who were 12 years old when they took the survey. This included a total of 584 children (104 in the treatment group, 480 in the comparison group).

The study used a regression model to compare the number of OSHA violations cited during inspections based on their order during the sample period—for example, during the second compared with the first inspection during the sample period—and for which different lengths of time had passed since the previous inspection.
Examining firms inspected multiple times, the study reported that the total number of violations cited in the second inspection was lower than the number of violations cited in the first. In these firms, the number of violations cited was larger for every additional year elapsed since the previous inspection.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is low. Although it provides interesting descriptive information, the study does not provide evidence of a causal effect of inspections, or their timing, on violations.","","In general, OSHA inspections are conducted for four reasons: a randomly conducted inspection at work sites in high-injury industries; if a complaint has been filed by employees or their representatives; if there has been an injury or fatality; and as a follow-up to a previous inspection. An inspector can issue citations for violations of safety standards observed during the inspection. Depending on the nature of the violation(s), the inspector might also issue a monetary penalty. Those firms with more violations are more likely to receive subsequent inspections to determine whether the violations have been corrected.
The key outcome of interest to the study was compliance with OSHA standards, as measured by the number of violations cited during an inspection.","The study used a regression model to compare the number of OSHA violations cited during reinspections with different sequence numbers and when different lengths of time had passed since the previous inspection. The model included controls for the type, scope, and category of the inspection; establishment size; industry; year; and the total number of inspections conducted for the firm over the sample period.
The authors used inspections data from the OSHA Integrated Management Information System for 549,398 inspections in manufacturing plants in the 29 federal OSHA states from 1972 to 2006.","The study reported that the total number of violations cited in the second inspection was at least 31 percent lower than the number of violations cited in the first inspection, among those firms inspected more than once. The difference was smaller for serious violations.
The number of violations cited was larger for every additional year elapsed since the previous inspection for firms inspected more than once. This difference was small, approximately 15 percent over five years.","This study described what happened to the pattern of violations in firms that received repeated inspections. Although it provides interesting descriptive information, the study does not provide evidence of a causal effect of repeated inspections or their timing on violations. This is because, by definition, the patterns of violations in firms can be observed only in those firms that were reinspected. However, the firms that were reinspected likely had different underlying safety levels than those that were not, because firms with more violations are more likely to be reinspected. Although the study controlled for the total number of inspections occurring over the study period, this might not completely capture differences across firms inspected one or many times.","",""

The paper concluded that bias and stereotypes, whether implicit or explicit, hindered girls’ development in STEM. According to the paper, promoting the idea that intelligence is not fixed and innate but can expand through hard work, dubbed the growth mindset, combats the notion that boys are inherently better at math and science than girls and encourages girls to persevere.
Further, women in academic and industry STEM positions continued to suffer from bias and stereotypes, which can manifest themselves through unsupportive atmospheres or distorted perceptions of female employees’ competence. Clear standards for advancement can counteract some of these tendencies.","","","","","","",""

They proposed several institutional mechanisms for this unusual success, including mentoring programs for several groups: academic leadership, faculty seeking promotion, new faculty, and students.
At the time of publication, two School of the Sciences faculty members had applied for promotion under the Faculty Mentoring and Evaluation Committee system, a formalized mentoring structure through which each faculty member received support and professional guidance from a mentor group comprising the mentee’s department chair and at least two faculty peers, one from outside the department. Both faculty members were successful.
Preliminary assessments of student mentoring programs that paired freshman biology or chemistry majors with upper-class students in their department suggest that participation augmented both mentors’ and mentees’ sense of community, support, and encouragement.

The Chicago site was one of 16 nationwide to participate in the Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) project.
The authors randomly assigned 1,728 TANF recipients to either a treatment group, which received enhanced employment services, or a control group, which received benefits as usual. The authors collected employment and earnings data from Illinois Unemployment Insurance (UI) records over four follow-up years and Food Stamps and TANF receipt data from administrative records over three follow-up years.
The study found that members of the treatment group received significantly less in average annual TANF benefits ($778 compared with $1,010 among control group members) but more in average annual Food Stamps ($4,111 compared with $3,959 among control group members). People in the ERA group were also more likely to be employed in the first year (69.7 percent) than people in the control group (66.2 percent).

This means we are confident that the estimated impacts are attributable to the Chicago ERA program, and not to other factors.","","The ERA project was introduced in 1999 as a nationwide exploration of factors that help welfare recipients not only find employment but retain their positions and advance in their careers. Chicago was one of 16 sites across the United States to receive funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to implement a program intended to improve TANF recipients’ employment outcomes.
In Chicago, TANF recipients who worked 30 hours or more per week for six months or more but were still eligible for TANF were eligible to receive enhanced employment services aimed at increasing their earnings. A career and income advisor met with and assisted each participant in developing a career and income advancement plan. The advisor counseled participants about how to advance in their current jobs and (more commonly) helped them apply for higher-paying jobs in companies that had relationships with the program. Services could include education and training, but fewer than one-quarter of program participants received those services. In addition to the 30-hour work requirement that was part of their TANF participation, clients had to maintain regular contact with their case managers; failure to do so could result in a sanction of their TANF benefits. The staff-client relationship often continued after people left TANF.","The study randomly assigned 1,728 Chicago TANF recipients were randomly assigned to either a treatment group, which could receive enhanced employment services through Chicago ERA, or a control group, which received TANF but was not offered enhanced employment services. Randomization took place from February 2002 to June 2003.

People in the ERA group were also more likely to be employed in the first year (69.7 percent) than people in the control group (66.2 percent). Beyond that, treatment and control group members’ earnings and employment histories were comparable over the follow-up period.","The authors noted that sanctions for failing to adhere to ERA program guidelines led some treatment group members to forfeit their TANF cash assistance rather than continue to participate in the program, reducing the average amount of TANF assistance received among treatment group members. The authors also suggested that the general reduction in TANF assistance among treatment group members might have led them to rely more on Food Stamps, and perhaps to qualify for higher levels of Food Stamps benefits.","",""

The authors administered a Likert scale survey to a convenience sample of undergraduate students enrolled in engineering programs that measured nine aspects of the department’s climate (for example, faculty involvement or support, diversity, and student integration with department) as well as the student’s intent to leave the program. The authors then used regression analysis to determine which of the nine aspects of climate predicted a student’s intent to leave the program. In-person interviews and six focus groups supplemented survey findings.
The study found that the aspects of college department climate predictive of a student’s intent to leave the program were institutional support (or the level of support and services provided by the institution to help students succeed), social and academic fit (or how well the student felt he or she was a part of the department), and personal agency and peer support (or one’s own involvement in the learning process and a peer atmosphere that encouraged success). There were no statistically significant differences in findings by gender or ethnicity, although interview and focus group data point toward complexities in how women and minorities experienced climate, suggesting that they might be more inclined than majority groups to rely on social support and fit than institutional support.","","","","","","",""

Related reports examine outcomes at 9 months and 3 years post-intervention.
The program’s effectiveness was evaluated using a randomized controlled trial conducted in 10 states. This report examined the effects of the program on participants’ educational attainment, earnings, employment, and other outcomes measured through a survey conducted about 21 months after participants entered the study.
The study found statistically significant, positive impacts of the ChalleNGe program on earnings, education, and training outcomes measured after 21 months.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is high because it is a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the effects estimated in this study are attributable to the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe program, and not to other factors.","","The National Guard Youth ChalleNGe program began in the early 1990s with a mission to target at-risk youth and equip them with the skills and training to have successful adult lives. To be eligible, youth must be 16 to 18 years of age, have dropped out of or been expelled from school, be unemployed, not be drug users, and not be heavily involved in the criminal justice system.
The 17-month program consists of a two-week Pre-Challenge phase, a 20-week Residential phase, and a one-year Post-Residential phase. Participants live in barracks-style housing (sometimes on a military base) in a very disciplined environment during the first two phases. They wear their hair short, are referred to as cadets, and wear military uniforms. In the Pre-Challenge phase, participants are oriented to the program’s rules and begin physical training. During the Residential phase, they participate in a number of different activities addressing eight core pillars: leadership/followership, responsible citizenship, service to community, life-coping skills, physical fitness, health and hygiene, job skills, and academic excellence. Most of their time is spent in an educational component that is usually geared toward receiving a General Educational Development (GED) certificate. During the Post-Residential phase of the program, after participants are placed in employment, education, or military service, they receive structured mentoring.","The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted at 10 program sites. In 2005 and 2006, about 3,000 eligible applicants were randomly assigned to either receive an offer to participate in the program (the treatment group) or to not receive an offer for the program in the current or future application cycles (the control group). For the 21-month survey, the authors attempted to survey a subsample of those originally randomly assigned (916 treatment and 592 control youth) and ultimately surveyed 736 treatment and 460 control youth. To estimate the effectiveness of the ChalleNGe program, the authors compared the outcomes of the treatment group with outcomes of the control group.
This study examined the effects of the ChalleNGe program on education, employment, and training outcomes, relative to the effects of other employment and training programs used by control group youth, measured about 21 months after random assignment. The study also examined outcomes on military enlistment, delinquency and criminal activity, health, sexual activity, and substance use.","The study found statistically significant, positive impacts of the ChalleNGe program on employment, education, and training outcomes measured after 21 months.
Twenty-one months after randomization, youth in the treatment group were earning more per week than their control counterparts ($209 compared to $169).
Compared to youth in the control group, youth in the treatment group were significantly more likely to have earned a GED certificate (48 percent versus 22 percent), a high school diploma (22 percent versus 16 percent), or college credits (25 percent versus 10 percent).
Thirty percent of youth in the treatment group had ever received vocational training compared to 23 percent of youth in the control group, a statistically significant difference.","Because this study only included youth who chose to apply for the program, these results cannot be assumed to apply to any youth who could be forced to attend the program. Youth who applied to the program may differ from other youth in a meaningful way. For example, youth who applied to ChalleNGe may have higher motivation than the “average” youth.
Not all youth who were randomly assigned to receive an offer to participate in the program did ultimately participate. However, youth were included in the treatment group regardless of whether they successfully completed the program. This could have reduced the estimated impact of the program. Additionally, sites were not randomly selected for participation in the study. Therefore, casual conclusions can only be drawn for the subset of sites that participated in this study and not the ChalleNGe program nationally.
The authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to education, employment, and earnings. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustment to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","California

The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high for the percentage employed and hours spent on work and training outcomes collected at the three-month follow-up because those outcomes were based on a well-implemented RCT with low attrition. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the job seekers’ workshop, and not to other factors. However, the quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low for the days to employment outcomes at the three-month follow-up and all outcomes at the six-month follow-up. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the job seekers’ workshop; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The job seekers’ workshops took place at the Na’Nizhoozhi Center, a substance abuse treatment center in Gallup and McKinley County, New Mexico. The workshops consisted of three four-hour sessions focused on individualized practice and feedback on interview skills. The workshops also covered locating jobs, completing job applications, and writing resumes. Individuals were eligible for the program if they were American Indian adults, were enrolled at the Na’Nizhoozhi Center for at least 10 days, were unemployed or underemployed, and were interested in participating in the labor market.","The study used an RCT design in which eligible participants were assigned to either the treatment group, which could attend the job seekers’ workshops, or the control group, which could not attend the workshops but instead watched two videos on interview skills. The treatment group consisted of 53 people; the control group had 49 members. Both groups were predominantly male and American Indian. The average age of the treatment group was 35 years old and for the control group it was 38 years old. The authors used three follow-up surveys to measure self-reported employment and training outcomes one, three, and six months after the job seekers’ workshop ended, although the study did not report findings from the one-month follow-up. The authors used a statistical model to compare the outcomes of treatment and control group members, but did not account for preexisting differences between the groups.","Employment. The study found no statistically significant relationship between the job seekers’ workshop and employment outcomes at the three-month follow-up.
Education and training. The study found that those in the job seekers’ workshop group spent significantly fewer hours on training activities, compared with those in the control group, at the three-month follow-up.","The authors noted that one individual in the control group had many more reported training hours than any other participant. The authors tested whether this individual’s extreme results drove the reported impacts of the program. When the authors excluded this individual from the analysis, the authors no longer found statistically significant results, suggesting that this one person might have driven the study’s reported findings on number of hours in training programs at the three-month follow-ups.
Although the study was an RCT, the following outcomes had high attrition: the days to employment outcome in the three-month follow-up and all of the outcomes in the six-month follow-up. The authors did not demonstrate that the treatment and control groups were similar at baseline and did not account for existing differences between the groups being compared in their analysis. Therefore, these outcomes receive a low evidence rating.","",""

Funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, SYEI aimed to reverse the steep decline in youth employment during the recession by providing employment opportunities for youth in the summer of 2009. Through the initiative, youth were placed in summer work experiences with local employers and their wages were paid with Recovery Act funds. The work experiences were fairly flexible, but had to be age appropriate and lead to youth meeting work readiness goals.
The authors analyzed state performance data through December 31, 2009, and data from in-depth site visits to 20 selected sites during July and August 2009.
The authors reported that it took a large effort to get the program up and running in such a short amount of time (about four months). Some sites reported having to make compromises along the way, given the quick time frame, but all reported satisfaction with their accomplishments. The initiative was implemented successfully in all the studied sites, with all sites able to recruit a sufficient number of participants and place them in employment. Youth participants and the employers interviewed were very positive about the initative.
Although the implementation of SYEI was considered a success, it was not without some initial challenges, including handling the large volume of applicants and determining their eligibility, reaching older youth ages 22 to 24 and veterans and their spouses, and appropriately matching youth to employers.","","","","","","",""

The Los Angeles site was one of 16 nationwide to participate in the Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) project. (See the CLEAR review of the interim report here.)
The authors randomly assigned nearly 1,200 single-parent recipients of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) to either a treatment group, which received Enhanced Job Club (EJC) services, or a control group, which received traditional job club (TJC) services.

Los Angeles was one of 16 sites across the United States and one of two in California to receive funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to implement a program intended to improve welfare recipients’ employment outcomes.
The EJC was designed to help TANF recipients find work in their desired careers, rather than quickly accepting a job that did not necessarily align with the recipient’s long-term career goals. The program combined job search skills, career planning, and a “step-down” approach to employment that initiated the job application process with the highest-paying position accessible to the participant. If unsuccessful at the highest level, participants then focused on positions offering opportunities for advancement; those who still had not found a position after four weeks of intensive job searching targeted part-time roles that would enhance their skills while providing them time to participate in educational programs. By contrast, TJC, the standard model, provided job search assistance and encouraged recipients to accept the first available position, regardless of whether it aligned with the person’s career goals.","Single-parent Los Angeles TANF applicants and recipients were randomly assigned to either EJC (the treatment group) or TJC (the control group), from June to September 2004. Most (91 percent) of the participants were women; their average age was 30; 57 percent had one or two children; 56 percent were Hispanic and 35 percent were black; most participants spoke English and 15 percent spoke Spanish; and slightly more than half of the members did not have a high school diploma or a GED certificate.

The authors employed a quasi-experimental design to compare average retention and persistence rates of students enrolled in learning community developmental English courses with those of students enrolled in traditional developmental English courses in the same semester.
The study found that retention rates were higher for students who enrolled in learning community developmental courses compared with their counterparts who took the same courses but in the traditional format. Furthermore, for the four semesters studied, learning community students were more likely to enroll in courses the following semester than were students who were not enrolled in learning communities. 
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is low because authors did not use sufficient controls in the analysis. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the learning communities. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","A learning community is an instructional model that provides students enrolled in linked courses opportunities to interact and engage with one another in a supportive learning environment. The learning community assessed in this study consisted of developmental English writing and reading courses at one and two levels below college-level English. Aside from the unique learning environment, students also received special services, such as in-course tutoring. In addition, course faculty received professional development and planning time to develop course themes.","The authors collected academic and administrative data on students enrolled in developmental English courses in a community college located in an urban area of southern California. The study evaluated students who enrolled in one of two developmental English course sequences: English 042 and 043 (two levels below college-level English) and English 051 and 056 (one level below college-level English) during any of the following four semesters: fall 2007, spring 2008, fall 2008, and spring 2009.
The intervention outcomes of interest in this study included (1) retention rates, which were equal to the proportion of students who completed the course relative to the total number of students enrolled after the drop deadline; and (2) persistence, defined as whether the student reenrolled the semester following completion of the developmental course sequence. The study used a quasi-experimental comparison group design, in which the authors compared retention and persistence rates of learning community and nonlearning community students to test for significant differences between groups.
The intervention sample included all 760 students enrolled in developmental English learning communities during the study period (fall 2007 to spring 2009). The comparison group consisted of a random sample of 760 students enrolled in the same developmental courses, but who took them in the traditional format that was not part of a learning community. For the persistence measure, however, only those students who successfully completed the developmental English course were evaluated, which reduced the overall sample size used for analysis by about half (61 percent of the original treatment group and 38 percent of the original comparison group).","The study found that retention rates were significantly higher for students enrolled in the learning community developmental courses English 043 and English 051 compared with their counterparts who took the same courses but in the traditional format. In addition, when courses were grouped by level (that is, English 042/043 and English 051/056) the differences between the treatment and comparison groups were statistically significant for both sets of courses.
Persistence rates in the grouped English 051/056 courses for fall 2007 to spring 2008 and for fall 2008 to spring 2009 were significantly higher for learning community students than for comparison students. In addition, persistence rates for fall 2008 to spring 2009 in English 051 were significantly higher for learning community students than for comparison students.","The authors did not account for self-selection into learning communities by including control variables in their analyses or by demonstrating that the treatment and comparison groups were similar on key characteristics before the intervention. In fact, the authors established that the treatment and comparison groups differed on observable characteristics (gender and ethnicity) in the analytic sample. Self-selection of treatment students into learning communities is a concern because it can bias estimates of the impacts of the intervention on outcomes. For example, more motivated students might be more likely to enroll in learning communities and to achieve higher persistence and retention rates. A lack of statistical controls for possible systematic differences between the treatment and comparison groups raises concerns that factors other than the intervention could account for the observed differences in retention and persistence rates. Therefore, the study is not eligible for a moderate causal evidence rating, the highest rating available for nonexperimental designs.","",""

The program paid 15 Reais ($6 USD) for each child who attended 85 percent of school days for a maximum of 3 children per family.

Staff helped clients develop and regularly revisit a personal development plan to identify and prepare for a job that interested them. A case manager from the local welfare office could authorize supportive services. VISION staff reportedly devoted most of their time to pre-employment services and helped clients gain access to public assistance. VISION also offered post-employment services that focused on promoting job retention and career advancement, including support in achieving the career goals set before employment.","From May 2002 to May 2004, 1,820 TANF applicants eligible for welfare-to-work programs were randomly assigned to VISION or the state’s typical welfare-to-work program, which was delivered at the local welfare office. This program also provided job search assistance but did not continue to provide services after participants found work. The analysis excluded the 316 participants from two-parent homes, and therefore analyzed 1,504 single parents.
The authors estimated employment and earnings impacts by comparing regression-adjusted UI wage records of treatment and control group members through three years after random assignment. The authors also calculated program impacts for benefits receipt measures, including whether participants received TANF or Food Stamps, through three years after random assignment using TANF and Food Stamps administrative records.","The study found that those in the Salem ERA group were 6.7 percentage points more likely than members of the control group to have received TANF benefits at any point during the first follow-up year.
Members of the treatment group also received, on average, $298 more in annual TANF benefits during the first three follow-up years compared with the control group. These differences were statistically significant.","The authors mentioned that the Salem ERA program was successful in implementing pre-employment services, but struggled to provide post-employment services due to high staff turnover and a statewide hiring freeze.
Further, the authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to employment, earnings, and benefits receipt. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","",""

The study also examined the impact of Easy Escalation, an option enabling individuals to quickly increase their retirement-plan contribution levels to a predetermined percentage of pay, on contribution rates.
The analysis was based on data on enrollment in and contributions to retirement plans from Hewitt Associates, a benefits administration and consulting firm. The study used an interrupted time series (ITS) design, analyzing changes in outcomes before and after the implementation of Quick Enrollment or Easy Escalation.
The study found that Quick Enrollment increased enrollment rates by 10 to 20 percentage points and that Easy Escalation increased the percentage of employees contributing to their savings plans at the higher, predetermined rate specified by Easy Escalation. 
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to Quick Enrollment or Easy Escalation. Other factors are likely to have contributed to the changes in enrollment and contribution rates.","","","","Across companies A and B, Quick Enrollment increased enrollment rates in retirement accounts by 10 to 20 percentage points.
In company B, about 15 percent of those who were enrolled in a savings plan but were contributing a low percentage of their pay increased their contribution to the predetermined 6 percent after Easy Escalation was implemented.","There were four pre-post sets of comparisons of interest in this study: (1) the first implementation of Quick Enrollment for seasoned employees at companies A and B, (2) the second and third waves of Quick Enrollment implementation at company B, (3) the first wave of Easy Escalation implementation at company B, and (4) the second wave of Easy Escalation implementation at company B. Interventions were considered separately based on whether they introduced employees to an investment option or reminded them that the option was available. Therefore, the second and third waves of Quick Enrollment and the second wave of Easy Escalation at company B are reviewed separately from the first introductions of Quick Enrollment and Easy Escalation.
Each intervention reviewed here was implemented only one or two times. This makes it difficult to conclude that the observed changes in enrollment rates were driven by the interventions themselves, instead of other concurrent changes. That is, the implementations could have easily coincided with other changes in policies or procedures. These other changes could drive the observed changes in enrollment and contributions.","Company A: A large health services company that had about 40,000 employees

The study used administrative data from the departments of Juvenile Services, Public Safety and Correctional Services, and Health and Mental Hygiene to compare outcomes of youth who participated in juvenile drug court with outcomes from a group of similar, drug court-eligible youth who did not participate.
The study found no statistically significant effects on recidivism, including total number of rearrests, rearrests for drug charges, and rearrest rates over a two-year period.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it was based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design. This means we would be somewhat confident that any estimated effects would be attributable to participation in the juvenile drug court, but other factors might also have contributed. However, the study did not find any statistically significant effects.","","The St. Mary’s County juvenile drug court program consisted of four phases, which involved varying dosages of the following program elements:
Drug court hearings
Case manager meetings
Inpatient or outpatient group and individual counseling
Family assessment and parenting skills training as necessary
Drug testing
Mandatory attendance in school/general equivalency degree preparation or work
Work on a community project
Curfew
Work toward education or employment goals
Youth advanced through the phases of the program by abstaining from drug use. They received incentives such as verbal praise, less restrictive reporting and curfews, tickets to community events, and gift cards. Participants could also receive sanctions, such as essay writing; community service; increased levels of reporting, testing, and the introduction of electronic monitoring; or moving back to an earlier program phase for engaging in unacceptable behavior. After completing all four program phases and 120 substance-free days, youth successfully completed the program and were eligible to expunge the cases from their juvenile criminal records.","The study compared the outcomes of youth who participated in the juvenile drug court from February 2004 to September 2008 with those of a matched comparison group. The comparison group included youth who lived in the same county from February 2004 to September 2008; committed a crime at an age younger than 18; had no history of violent offenses or drug trafficking; had received moderate-, high-, or intensive-level supervision; and had a juvenile record with a drug, alcohol, assault, theft, burglary, or trespassing charge, but did not participate in the juvenile drug court. The comparison group was matched to the drug court group by gender, race and ethnicity, age index at arrest, type of charge for eligible arrest, and prior criminal history. The authors used statistical methods to compare the outcomes of drug court and comparison youth, controlling for gender, age, race, time at risk to reoffend, and characteristics of arrests.","The study did not find any statistically significant effects of the juvenile drug court on recidivism, including the total number of rearrests for all offense types, the number of rearrests specifically for drug charges, and the rates of rearrests over a two-year period.","The outcomes for total number of rearrests and the number of rearrests for drug offenses reflected whether the intervention affected the frequency of new arrests, whereas the rate of rearrest over a two-year period estimated the overall effect on recidivism.
To increase the sample of potential comparison group youth, the authors had to include youth under moderate-level supervision in addition to youth under high or intensive supervision, which was originally the target group of interest. As a result, there might be differences in the average risk level between the drug court youth and comparison youth, which could affect the likelihood of rearrest independent of whether the youth participated in drug court. The statistical analysis did not include supervision level as a control variable.","",""

[PASS - Riverside]","The study’s objective was to estimate the impact of post-employment job supports and supportive services on recent welfare recipients’ employment and benefits receipt outcomes after four years. The Riverside Post-Assistance Self-Sufficiency (PASS) site was one of two in Riverside, California, that participated in the Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) project.
The authors randomly assigned 2,770 employed single parents who had recently left the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program to either a treatment group that received ERA services or a control group that could participate in other employment-related programs in the community. The authors analyzed data from Unemployment Insurance (UI), TANF, and Food Stamps administrative records and surveys administered 12 and 42 months after random assignment.
The study found that individuals assigned to the Riverside PASS ERA program had significantly higher earnings in the first and fourth years after random assignment and were more likely to be employed in every quarter of the fourth year, compared with those in the control group.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is high for most outcomes because it was based on a well-conducted randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Riverside PASS ERA program and not to other factors. However, the study receives a moderate causal evidence rating for outcomes from the 12-month survey because that data source had high attrition, yet the analysis included adequate statistical controls to correct for resulting imbalance.","","The ERA project was introduced in 1999 as a nationwide exploration of factors that help welfare recipients not only find employment but retain their positions and advance in their careers. Riverside PASS was one of 16 sites across the United States to receive funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to implement a program intended to improve welfare recipients’ employment outcomes.
Riverside’s PASS program aimed to improve employment retention and career advancement among employed individuals who had recently left the TANF program. Local PASS service providers contacted clients randomly assigned to the treatment group and then provided post-employment services and supportive services based on clients’ needs. Available services included case management; counseling and mentoring; reemployment activities such as assistance with job search and resume preparation; life-skills workshops; referrals to training and education opportunities; supportive services such as child care, transportation, books, and equipment; and referrals to social services programs.","From July 2002 to June 2003, about 2,770 employed single parents who had recently exited TANF were randomly assigned to either a treatment group, which received ERA services, or a control group, which could participate in other programs offered in the community. Most participants (90 percent) were female, about half were Hispanic, and the average age was 31 years.
The authors estimated employment and earnings impacts by comparing regression-adjusted UI wage records of treatment and control group members over the four years after random assignment. The authors also calculated program impacts for benefits receipt measures, including whether participants received TANF or Food Stamps, through four years after random assignment using TANF and Food Stamps administrative records. Finally, the authors estimated impacts on self-reported employment and earnings using data from 12- and 42-month surveys administered to a subsample of study participants.","The study found that those in the PASS program group were 3.7 percentage points more likely than their control group counterparts to be employed in every quarter during the fourth year after random assignment. They also earned, on average, $967 more in the fourth year than control group members. These differences were statistically significant at the 5 percent level.
PASS program group members earned, on average, $852 more in the first year after random assignment than those in the control group, significant at the 1 percent level.","Many sample members selected for the 12-month survey did not respond, introducing the potential for sample imbalance among survey respondents. Imbalance in the respondent sample could, in turn, bias the estimated program effects. Because the authors statistically accounted for possible differences in the background characteristics of treatment and control respondents to the 12-month survey, the earnings and employment outcomes from this survey receive a moderate rating. Because this review is based on a previous review conducted by the Employment Strategies for Low-Income Adults Evidence Review which did not report outcomes with a low evidence rating, CLEAR did not review two public assistance outcomes from the 12-month survey. These outcomes received a low evidence rating because the authors neither demonstrated that the groups were similar before the program began nor accounted for any baseline differences that might have existed between the study groups.
Across data sources, the study authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to employment, earnings, and benefits receipt. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not report that they performed statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","",""

The authors used a nonexperimental design, matching youth who participated in the juvenile drug court with a comparison group of similar youth who were eligible to participate in juvenile drug court, but instead participated in the traditional juvenile justice system. The authors used administrative data to compare the mean number of juvenile rearrests over a two-year follow-up period.
The study found that drug court participants had significantly fewer juvenile rearrests, both overall and specifically for drug charges, than comparison youth.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it was based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Baltimore County Juvenile Drug Court, but other factors might also have contributed.","","The Baltimore County Juvenile Drug Court was a dispositional alternative program for youth in the juvenile justice system with substance abuse problems; the program operated in multiple locations in Baltimore County. The program had four phases, which required participants to attend drug court hearings and perform community service; take random drug tests; and participate in case management, group and individual therapy, education, and family counseling. Service receipt was intensive during the first two phases, comprising frequent meetings and drug tests, and transitions to less intensive after-care services during the last two phases. Participants were involved with the program for a minimum of 12 months, and the average time in the program was about 13 months for all youth, regardless of whether they graduated from the program. Following successful completion of the program, including abstaining from drugs or alcohol for 90 consecutive days, the state’s attorney dropped the charges against the youth.
To be eligible for the program, youth had to be adjudicated delinquent, residents of Baltimore County, ages 13 to 17 at the time of offense, and have no history of violent offenses or drug trafficking. Only youth committing eligible offenses—including drug, alcohol, or tobacco use; destruction of property; second-degree assault; theft; burglary; and trespassing—were admitted.","The authors matched 186 youth who participated in the drug court program from 2003 to 2008 with 147 court-involved youth who received traditional court processing. The youth in the comparison group were under moderate-, high-, or intensive-level juvenile supervision from 2004 to 2008. The treatment and comparison groups were matched on demographic characteristics, type of charge, level of supervision, and prior criminal history. Most of the treatment and comparison group members were males and white, and the mean age at arrest was 15. The authors used statistical techniques to compare outcomes of juvenile drug court participants with those of youth in the comparison group. The authors controlled for gender, age at qualifying arrest, ethnicity, number and type of prior arrests, type of qualifying arrest, and time at risk to reoffend.","The study found that Baltimore County Juvenile Drug Court participants had significantly fewer juvenile rearrests for drug charges and significantly lower juvenile rearrest rates overall than youth in the comparison group; 56 percent of all drug court participants were rearrested during the two-year follow up period versus 76 percent of the comparison group youth.","The Department of Juvenile Services did not release the names of comparison group youth, so the study could not obtain adult criminal justice data for them. Because more than 85 percent of the treatment group (and, presumably, a similar proportion of the comparison group) became adults at some point during the two-year follow-up period, looking only at juvenile arrest records might not capture the full impact of the program.
Because the comparison group was composed of eligible youth who were not referred to or declined to participate in juvenile drug court, it is possible that the results were affected by characteristics of the comparison group (for example, psychological, addiction-related, or material hardship-related barriers to program participation) that could be correlated with the outcome of interest. It is not clear how many comparison group youth decided not to participate in the program or were not offered the program.","",""

The study was a randomized controlled trial carried out at one VHA medical center site over four years. Eligible veterans were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which could participate in the TWE program, or to the control group, which could not participate in TWE but could receive JP services. The authors used data from participant surveys to measure impacts.
The study found that members of the treatment group worked significantly more hours in paid employment (including employment sponsored by the TWE program itself) and significantly more total weeks in paid employment, compared with the control group. The study also found that the treatment group earned significantly higher total income for the year (including noncompetitive TWE employment income) than the control group.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not provide enough information to calculate attrition and did not include sufficient controls in their analysis to establish that treatment and control groups were similar on observable characteristics at baseline for the analytic sample. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to TWE. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The TWE program placed participants in structured, paid employment at companies contracted with the program in the community or directly within VHA medical centers. Participants progressed through different job placements, in terms of hours worked, difficulty of the position, and level of independence given in the role. Program participants continued any clinically warranted treatment through the VHA medical centers and received job-coaching services. TWE also assisted participants with identifying goals and completing job searches. Formal assessments and skill-building were not a primary focus of the program. The length of the program was tailored to the needs of the participants and placements were intended to improve professional skills through the experience of paid employment.
To participate in the study, participants had to meet the following inclusion criteria: (1) be eligible for VHA services; (2) meet criteria for psychiatric diagnosis of bipolar disorder, major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, or other anxiety disorder, and have current or life-time drug or alcohol abuse, with substance use within the past 90 days; (3) not meet criteria for schizophrenia or other schizoaffective disorder diagnosis; (4) not have a recent psychiatric hospitalization or suicidal and homicidal thoughts in the past six months; (5) have worked at least one day of competitive employment in the past three years, have the goal of returning to work and not have medical restrictions that would limit return to work; (6) be younger than 56, with at least 10 years of formal education; and (7) and be likely to maintain contact with research staff.","From 2006 to 2010, 89 eligible veterans entered TWE services at the Bedford, Massachusetts, VA program. Among them, 50 veterans were randomly assigned to the treatment group, which could participate in the TWE program, and 39 to the control group, which could not participate in TWE but could receive JP services. JP services included a review of job and employment goals with program staff and referrals to available job-placement services and resources, including Internet job listings, computer access, and support in creating a resume. The authors collected data on study participants’ demographics, work histories, and clinical histories through baseline questionnaires; they also collected outcome data on employment and income through follow-up questionnaires at 6 and 12 months following program enrollment. The authors also accessed VHA medical records to confirm use of substance abuse services and psychiatric hospitalizations. To assess potential impacts of the TWE program, the authors compared the unadjusted differences between the treatment and control groups on various employment outcomes.","The study found that the TWE group worked significantly more total hours than the control group over the one-year follow-up period for all paid employment, which included positions from both competitive and TWE-subsidized employment. The study also found that the treatment group worked significantly more total weeks in any paid employment over the one-year follow-up period than the control group (28 versus 18 weeks). Finally, in the one year follow-up period, the treatment group earned significantly more total income from any paid employment than the control group ($10,353 versus $6,581).","Ten members of the control group received TWE services before final data collection. The authors stated that data for these people were censored at the point that they entered treatment services. However, it is not clear how their follow-up data were used in the impact analysis, meaning attrition from the randomized sample cannot be calculated given the information in the study.
The significant, positive findings for earnings and employment in any paid employment positions could largely have been driven by program participation, as income resulting directly from involvement in TWE was counted in the any paid employment outcomes.
Finally, the authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to employment. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in this domain is likely to be overstated.","",""

The study found that SVORI participants were more likely than nonparticipants to be enrolled in school 3 months post-release (68 and 52 percent, respectively) and were more likely than nonparticipants to have a job with benefits 15 months post-release (69 and 40 percent, respectively).
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it was based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the SVORI program, but other factors might also have contributed.","","The National Institute of Justice funded the SVORI program and required that enrollees be younger than 35 and that the program provide community supervision after release from confinement. This report focused on the results for youth. The program’s goals were to improve the quality of life and self-sufficiency of reentering youth through employment, housing, family, and community involvement; to improve health by addressing substance use and mental health issues; to reduce recidivism through close post-release supervision; and to achieve systems change through multiagency collaboration. The program included three phases (in-prison, post-release supervision, and post-supervision). Local programs were customized and there was considerable variation in the treatment condition across sites.
In Colorado, the SVORI participants received a parole advocate who provided concentrated resources during the reentry process. The program included a focus on making the family an important part of the transition process. South Carolina assigned SVORI youth a reintegration coordinator in place of a community caseworker. Compared to community caseworkers, these coordinators provided more intensive case management and supervision and planned for transition and reintegration earlier for SVORI participants. In Florida, SVORI participants were provided with curriculum and release planning activities before their release. After release, they received ongoing educational and vocational support. In Kansas, SVORI participants received intensive support and planning services from a community reentry facilitator.","The study included 337 males with a mean age of 17 who had been released from incarceration in the four study sites. The authors matched SVORI participants to similar nonparticipants using propensity scores developed from baseline demographic information and pre-intervention measures of education and criminal history. When possible, the comparison group members included youth who were released from the same correctional facilities and were returning to the same geographic areas as the SVORI participants. Comparison group members received standard post-release services.
Researchers conducted interviews with participants and nonparticipants to collect information on educational and other outcomes 3, 9, and 15 months following their release from incarceration. Data collection occurred from July 2004 to May 2007.","Juvenile SVORI participants were more likely than nonparticipants to be enrolled in school 3 months post-release (68 versus 52 percent). However, this did not extend to the 9 and 15-month follow-ups.
Juvenile SVORI participants were more likely than nonparticipants to have jobs with benefits 15 months post-release (69 versus 40 percent).
There were no statistically significant effects on recidivism.","The authors noted that, by and large, SVORI participants received most of the services offered to them as part of the program. However, results from the follow-up surveys suggested that most youth reported greater service needs than actual services received.","",""

The authors randomly assigned 1,179 employed single parents who were former Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program participants to either a treatment group that received employment retention services from Eugene’s Progress Towards Retention, Opportunities, Growth, Enhancement and Self-Sufficiency (PROGRESS) program or a control group that could participate in other employment-related programs in the community. The authors analyzed data from Unemployment Insurance (UI), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and Food Stamps administrative records and a survey administered 12 months after random assignment.
The study found that those in the PROGRESS group were 7 percentage points less likely than control group members to be employed in the third year after random assignment and 6.6 percentage points less likely to have been employed in every quarter of that year.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is high because it was based on a well-conducted randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Eugene ERA program and not to other factors.","","The ERA project was introduced in 1999 as a nationwide exploration of factors that helped welfare recipients not only find employment but retain their positions and advance in their careers. Eugene, Oregon, was one of 16 sites across the United States, including 4 in Oregon, to receive funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to implement a program intended to improve welfare recipients’ employment outcomes.
Eugene’s ERA project was a voluntary post-employment program that provided retention and career-focused case management. A case manager from the Oregon Department of Human Services and a career development specialist from Lane Community College worked with each client in Oregon Department of Human Services branch offices. The team created a career development plan, including a needs assessment, career goals, and action steps, and documented any need for vocational assessments. Subsequent meeting topics depended on a participant’s needs but included job coaching, education and training referrals, and counseling.","From June 2002 to June 2004, evaluators randomly assigned employed people who were leaving TANF, most of whom were single mothers and were underemployed. These clients had completed an “I Have a Job” form required of newly employed TANF applicants and TANF leavers working at least 20 hours per week. Evaluators randomly assigned clients who had completed this form without contacting them or confirming their interest in participating. Participants were enrolled from June 2002 through June 2004. The analysis included 1,179 participants, 585 in the treatment condition and 594 in the control condition. About 93 percent of participants were female, 85 percent were white non-Hispanic, and the average age was 29.4 years.
The authors estimated employment and earnings impacts by comparing regression-adjusted UI wage records of treatment and control group members over the three years after random assignment.

The study used a randomized controlled trial to assign former prisoners to either the transitional jobs program or to a control group that was offered job search assistance. The authors compared the two groups’ employment and earnings outcomes one year after random assignment, controlling for participants’ characteristics before random assignment.
The study found that members of the transitional jobs group were 8.6 percentage points more likely than control group members to be employed during all four quarters of the year after random assignment, but 8.9 percentage points less likely to have unsubsidized employment during the year after random assignment. Transitional jobs group members’ total earnings from all jobs were $1,419 higher, on average, than those of control group members during the year after random assignment, but their total earnings from unsubsidized jobs were $625 lower.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the TJRD, and not to other factors.","","Funded by the Joyce Foundation, the JEHT Foundation, and the US. Department of Labor, the TJRD provided former prisoners with 30 to 40 hours of temporary paid employment weekly, job search assistance, and other supports, including job coaching. Cohorts of participants were recruited in Chicago, Illinois; Detroit, Michigan; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and St. Paul, Minnesota from early 2007 through September 2008. Participants in later cohorts in the Milwaukee and St. Paul sites also received bonuses (up to $1,500) for obtaining and retaining unsubsidized employment. Participants began reporting to their temporary jobs within two weeks of random assignment. The program offered 90 days of subsidized employment, with the option to extend as slots were available.
The program was offered to men ages 18 and older who had been released from prison within the previous 90 days, were interested in and available for full-time employment, and had not participated in transitional employment within the previous year.","The program recruited and randomly assigned 1,813 eligible ex-offenders either to TJRD or to a control group that was offered job search assistance. Employment and earnings data were collected quarterly from state unemployment insurance and transitional job site records for one year after random assignment. The authors estimated program impacts by comparing regression-adjusted means and percentages between the treatment and control group members.","The study found that treatment group members were 8.6 percentage points more likely than control group members to be employed in any job, either subsidized by TJRD or unsubsidized, during all four quarters of the year after random assignment (20.2 versus 11.6 percent).

Yet many clients do not obtain competitive employment, job tenure is usually short, and studies have provided little evidence for better targeting IPS. This study used in-group analysis of a large sample of IPS recipients to help predict competitive employment outcomes in these types of programs.
The study combined data from four recent randomized controlled trials (all of which found IPS more effective than alternative approaches) to estimate the relationship between baseline characteristics and job acquisition and retention. Work history was the only statistically significant predictor of employment—a finding the authors said challenged the practice of labeling clients with certain clinical and background attributes as “high risk,” perhaps because IPS is designed to address such attributes.
Among those who obtained employment, only receipt of Supplemental Security Income and Social Security Disability Insurance were associated with fewer total weeks worked. Based on this result and other recent studies, the authors suggest that, although IPS is the current best practice for helping people with SMI return to work, fear of losing disability payments and health care benefits are powerful disincentives to sustaining competitive employment. They conclude that helping people with SMI leave the disability roles would require changes in federal disability income support policies and insurance regulations.","","","","","","",""

This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Direct Support Program; other factors are likely to have contributed.","Absence of conflict of interest.","The government of Ethiopia has historically offered social welfare programs to protect citizens from periods of famine and improve food security. In 2005, they began a new social assistance program called the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), which had two components: 1) the Public Work Program (PWP) and 2) the Direct Support Program (DSP). The DSP provided cash, food, and educational support, but did not require work activities to receive the support. The DSP targeted households that do not have people who can work, who are food insecure and do not have another source of support. For example, household members were not considered able to work if they had a disability, were lactating mothers, were pregnant, or were orphaned teenagers. Age and disability status were the primary eligibility criteria for participation in the DSP. The DSP participants were selected by each community Food Security Task Force; however, the specific method of selecting households varied by community. The program was implemented in both rural and urban areas of Ethiopia.","The author used a nonexperimental design to compare the labor and schooling outcomes of children in households that participated in the DSP with those who did not, using data from the 2006 Young Lives survey. The Young Lives survey provided data on how much time youth spend in different activities, including schooling and paid work. It also asked about household demographics and participation in social programs since 2002, including whether they participated in DSP or other social programs; this information was used to identify participants for the treatment and comparison groups. The author created a matched comparison group based on child and household socioeconomic characteristics. The study included only children who were 12 years old when they took the survey. This included a total of 955 children (236 in the treatment group and 719 in the comparison group). Child labor was measured as the number of hours in a day spent in paid work outside the home, unpaid work outside the home, and combined time spent in paid and unpaid work outside the home. Schooling was measured as the number of hours spent in school in a day. The author used statistical models to estimate program impacts.","Employment/Child labor
The study found a statistically significant relationship between DSP participation and a lower amount of total time spent in work outside of the home (whether paid or unpaid).
The study also found a statistically significant relationship between DSP participation and a lower amount of time spent doing only unpaid work outside the home. However, there was no a significant relationship between DSP participation and time spent doing only paid work outside of the home.
Education (School participation/enrollment)
The study did not find a significant relationship between DSP participation and time spent in school.","The authors did not account for preexisting differences between the groups in child labor or schooling outcomes before DSP participation. These preexisting differences between the groups—and not the DSP— could explain the observed differences in outcomes.","",""

The study was a randomized controlled trial; eligible volunteers were randomly assigned to either a treatment group, which was eligible for the more-generous work incentive, or a control group that was not. Data sources included state and federal administrative data on Wisconsin SSDI recipients who were enrolled in BOPD.
The study found no statistically significant differences between treatment and control group members on employment status, earnings, or reliance on benefits in the eight quarters of follow-up.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this study is high for results through the fifth quarter of follow-up, but moderate for subsequent periods because of high attrition in those periods. This means we would be confident that estimated impacts through the fifth quarter of follow-up were attributable to the BOPD and not other factors. However, the study found no such statistically significant impacts.","","Administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA), the BOPD was a pilot test of the later Benefit Offset National Demonstration. The primary intervention was a benefit offset that replaced the so-called cash cliff SSDI recipients who work eventually experience. The cash cliff refers to the fact that SSDI recipients who have completed a nine-month trial work period followed by a three-month grace period have all their SSDI benefits suspended or terminated if they earn more than a threshold amount known as substantial gainful activity (SGA). The benefit offset replaces the complete loss of all benefits for working SSDI recipients, instead gradually withdrawing the SSDI benefit by $1 for every $2 earned above the SGA amount.
BOPD was implemented in four states: Connecticut, Utah, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Apart from recruiting SSDI recipients who received benefits solely based on their own earnings records, had completed a trial work period within the past 72 months, and were not concurrently receiving Supplemental Security Income benefits, the states were free to select their own program eligibility criteria. The Wisconsin BOPD went into effect in August 2005 and was a collaboration of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, the University of Wisconsin-Stout, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Referred to as the Pathways Project, all aspects of the intervention—from recruitment to service provision—were administered through 21 nonprofit provider agencies across the state. Program enrollment ended after October 2006.","The BOPD in Wisconsin was evaluated using a randomized controlled trial. Wisconsin SSDI recipients deemed eligible for the pilot were randomly assigned to either the treatment group (N = 262), which received the benefit offset, or the control group (N = 206), which received services as usual. Both groups remained eligible to receive benefits counseling and other standard services.
The study used data from several sources. State unemployment insurance records provided employment outcome data. SSA provided state evaluators with information on the participants’ SSDI and Medicare receipt. Key employment outcomes included employment, earnings, income, and the probability of earning at least three times the SGA amount. Income was defined as earned income plus income from SSDI benefits.","The study found no statistically significant impacts of BOPD on employment, earnings, income, or the probability of earning at least three times the SGA amount across the eight follow-up quarters examined.","The volunteers who participated in the BOPD are not likely to be representative of the larger SSDI recipient population because they were typically recruited from organizations that helped clients obtain employment, and are therefore likely to be representative of the 20 percent of SSDI recipients who report an expectation of returning to work. In addition, the decision by SSA to restrict eligibility to SSDI recipients who completed their trial work period within the past 72 months disqualified potential participants with longer work histories; these people might have benefited the most from the program.","",""

The Los Angeles Reach for Success (RFS) site was one of two in Los Angeles that participated in the Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) project.
The authors randomly assigned 5,700 employed single-parent participants in Los Angeles’s Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program who were working full-time to either a treatment group that received RFS services or to a control group that received standard TANF services. The authors analyzed data from Unemployment Insurance (UI), TANF, and Food Stamps administrative records and surveys administered 12 and 42 months after random assignment.
The study found that, 12 to 42 months after random assignment, RFS group members’ employment, earnings, and benefits receipt did not differ significantly from those of control group members.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is high because it was based on a well-conducted randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that any estimated effects would be attributable to Los Angeles’ RFS and not to other factors. However, the study did not find statistically significant effects.","","The ERA project was introduced in 1999 as a nationwide exploration of factors that help welfare recipients not only find employment but retain their positions and advance in their careers. Los Angeles was one of 16 sites across the United States to receive funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to implement a program intended to improve welfare recipients’ employment outcomes. (The authors reported results for two sites in Los Angeles, including Los Angeles RFS, separately, so CLEAR also reviewed the results for those sites separately.)
Employed TANF recipients assigned to the Los Angeles RFS group received intensive marketing about available services and individualized attention from case managers. Specifically, RFS helped clients more effectively access work supports, such as child care and transportation, as well as negotiate work-related issues through the development of soft skills, such as interpersonal and communication skills. Services were tailored to clients’ needs and level of motivation. Case managers worked with small caseloads and used work-, education-, and training-based strategies to provide coaching and assistance to clients.","From July 2002 to June 2004, 5,700 single-parent TANF recipients working at least 32 hours per week in full-time jobs were randomly assigned to either a treatment group, which received RFS services, or a control group, which received standard TANF services through the existing program. Regular post-employment services for the control group were less individualized and included few job retention services other than work supports. Career advancement services consisted primarily of support for education and training and were available only on clients’ request.
The authors estimated employment and earnings impacts by comparing regression-adjusted UI wage records of treatment and control group members over the three years after random assignment. The authors also calculated program impacts for benefit receipt measures, including whether participants received TANF or Food Stamps, through three years after random assignment using TANF and Food Stamps administrative records. Finally, the authors estimated additional employment and earnings outcomes 12 and 42 months after random assignment using surveys.","The study found that, 12 to 42 months after random assignment, treatment group members’ employment, earnings, and benefits receipt did not differ significantly from those of control group members.","The authors noted that RFS dedicated more resources to job search and reemployment services than anticipated, given high rates of job loss among participants. The implementation study showed that RFS group participants were more likely to have received help with a career assessment but otherwise did not differ significantly from the control group in terms of program participation and services received.","",""

The Riverside Phase 2 site was one of two in Riverside, California, that participated in the Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) project.
The authors randomly assigned 3,029 employed single-parent participants in Riverside’s Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program to one of two treatment groups (Work Plus and Training Focused) that received differing ERA services or to a control group that received standard TANF services. The authors analyzed data from Unemployment Insurance (UI), TANF, and Food Stamps administrative records and a survey administered 12 months after random assignment.
The study found that, compared with the control group, those in the Riverside Work Plus group were 3.2 percentage points more likely to have received Food Stamps in the first year after random assignment.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is high because it was based on a well-conducted randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Riverside Work Plus program and not to other factors.","","The ERA project was introduced in 1999 as a nationwide exploration of factors that help welfare recipients not only find employment but retain their positions and advance in their careers. Riverside included 3 of 16 sites across the United States to receive funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to implement a program intended to improve welfare recipients’ employment outcomes. (The authors reported results for a third site in Riverside separately, so CLEAR also reviewed the results for that site separately.)
TANF recipients assigned to the Riverside Work Plus and the Training Focused programs could receive intensive case management and enhanced support services, all aimed at encouraging employment stability. In the Work Plus program, staff encouraged clients to attend education and training activities after working at least 20 hours per week. Participation in education and training activities was premised on the belief that working reinforces the value of education and training and that working while in school or in training increases the likelihood of program completion and the use of newly attained skills. In the Training Focused program, staff encouraged clients to attend education and training (including vocational training) activities, and clients could decrease or eliminate their work hours if they participated in education and training.
Both programs also provided supportive services (such as child care, transportation, and payments to participate in program activities); job search services; and referrals to social services (such as mental health, domestic violence, and substance abuse) and public assistance programs. Work Plus was implemented by the county welfare agency and Training Focused program was implemented by the county workforce development agency.","From January 2001 to October 2003, 3,029 employed, single-parent TANF recipients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, each of which received differing ERA services, or a control group, which received standard TANF services through the existing welfare-to-work “Work Focused” program. Clients in this program were eligible to receive TANF, Food Stamps, child care and transportation assistance, and medical coverage. They also received limited and reactive case management. The authors estimated employment and earnings impacts by comparing regression-adjusted UI wage records of treatment and control group members over the four years after random assignment.
The authors also calculated program impacts for benefits receipt measures, including whether participants received TANF or Food Stamps, through four years after random assignment using TANF and Food Stamps administrative records. Finally, the authors estimated additional employment and earnings outcomes from a survey administered 12 months after random assignment.","The study found that, compared with the control group, those in the Riverside Work Plus group were 3.2 percentage points more likely to have received Food Stamps in the first year after random assignment. However, the study found no statistically significant effect on employment or earnings.
The Riverside Training Focused program had no statistically significant effect on earnings, employment, or benefits receipt compared with the control group.","The study authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to employment, earnings, and benefits receipt. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not report that they performed statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","",""

(See the CLEAR review of the 2008 report here.)
Using program data and state UI records, the authors matched treatment to comparison group cases and conducted regression analyses to estimate the effect of the intervention.
The study found that participation in the REM program was associated with an increase in the likelihood that jobseekers were employed in the 10 quarters following program participation among the 2006 cohort. Participation in the REM program was also associated with an increase in the likelihood that jobseekers were employed, a decrease in quarterly earnings, and an increase in the likelihood jobseekers filed UI claims in the six quarters following program participation among the 2007 cohort.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate for earnings outcomes in both cohorts and for employment outcomes for the 2006 cohort because it was based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects on employment and earnings are attributable to the REM program, but other factors might also have contributed. The quality of causal evidence presented for the UI benefit claiming outcome for both cohorts and the employment outcome for the 2007 cohort is low because the authors did not ensure that the groups being compared were similar before the intervention. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects on UI benefit claiming outcome are attributable to the REM program; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The REM program combined short-term job preparedness and occupational skills training in combination with active job placement assistance to improve employment rates and decrease periods of unemployment. Treatment group members received pre-employment training on basic job preparedness and employment skills. Participants were then offered the opportunity to participate in an occupational skills training program, which the city and county subsidized. The participants could choose one of nine training programs focused on a specific occupational field (including truck driving and nursing), which varied in length and content. Travis County Health and Human Services Department and Workforce Solutions led the program, which took place from January to October 2006 for the 2006 cohort and from February to October 2007 for the 2007 cohort.","The study included 103 participants in the 2006 cohort and 85 participants in the 2007 cohort matched to comparison group members selected from a pool of WorkInTexas’s registered jobseekers and Workforce Investment Act “core” services recipients. REM participants were selected based on participation in workforce programs that served disadvantaged groups, including ex-offenders and recipients of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and food stamps. The authors matched REM participants to comparison group members based on similar demographic characteristics and employment and earnings history over the four years before the program began. The authors examined differences in outcomes over the 10 quarters following the program while accounting for pre-intervention differences between treatment and comparison group members.","The study found that participation in the 2006 REM cohort was associated with a 4.6 percentage point statistically significant increase in the likelihood that jobseekers were employed in quarters following program participation.
The study also found that participation in the 2007 REM cohort was associated with a 5.6 percentage point statistically significant increase in the likelihood that jobseekers were employed in quarters following program participation.
Participants in the 2007 REM cohort also experienced a statistically significant $520 decrease in quarterly earnings following program participation.
Additionally, the percentage of participants in the 2007 REM cohort who filed UI claims in the quarters following program participation was 3.3 percentage points higher than the comparison group, a statistically significant finding.","The quality of causal evidence presented for the UI benefit claiming outcome for both cohorts is low because the authors did not include pre-intervention public benefits or socioeconomic status as a matching variable when selecting the comparison group and did not adjust for potential pre-intervention differences in these characteristics in the analysis. The quality of causal evidence is also low for the employment outcome for the 2007 cohort because the matched groups were not similar with respect to pre-intervention employment status.
The authors did not have access to data on ex-offender status and thus did not account for it in their analysis. The treatment group included participants of a program that targets formerly incarcerated workers (among other disadvantaged groups), so the proportions of offenders could vary between the groups. For this reason, the estimated impacts may reflect differences in outcomes due to differences in offender status in addition to any effects due to REM.","",""

This study used two laboratory experiments to examine the relationship between the number of choices offered and decision making. 
Individuals were asked to choose between risky gambles and sure payoffs, with the number of choices randomly determined.
The authors found that when individuals were presented with a larger number of choices, they tended to choose simpler payoff options.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this portion of the study is high. This means we are confident that an increase in the number of choices an individual is given causes him or her to choose a less complex payoff option.
Analysis of 401(k) data 
The study further aimed to determine whether the number of fund options offered by a 401(k) plan influenced the share of assets allocated to a given class of funds (for example, equities or bonds) by plan members.
The authors analyzed differences in portfolio allocations based on the number of funds available using regression analysis, controlling for other 401(k), firm, and employee characteristics.
The analysis demonstrated that as the number of investment options increased, people tended to allocate more of their 401(k) savings to money market and bond funds at the expense of equity funds.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this portion of the study is low. This means we cannot be confident that an increase in the number of funds offered in a retirement plan causes an increase in the share of funds allocated to money market and bond funds and a concurrent decrease in the share of funds allocated to equities.","","","","In the experimental settings, people were more likely to choose simpler and less risky options when they were offered a larger number of choices.
The share of funds allocated to equities decreased as the number of total fund options increased. On average, for every 10 funds added to a plan, allocation to equity funds decreased by 3.28 percentage points.
An increase in the total number of funds offered in a plan was associated with an increase in contributions allocated to bond and money market funds. Specifically, an increase of 10 funds in a plan was associated with a statistically significant 1.98 percentage point increases in the share of funds allocated to bonds. The share of funds allocated to money market accounts also rose, but this change was insignificant.","The two experiments were randomized controlled trials with low attrition. Additionally, there were no apparent confounds that could lead to biases in these results. Note, however, that the results of these experiments should be interpreted carefully. This study analyzed peoples’ responses to gambles involving small amounts of money. The choices observed might not accurately reflect decisions people would make about savings for retirement when large sums of money are potentially at risk.
The regression analysis of actual investment decisions controlled for important employee-, plan- and firm-level variables; however, this analysis essentially compared individuals with access to a larger number of investment options with those with access to a smaller number of options. It could be that those who invest in funds offering a larger degree of choice are inherently different from those invested in other plans. For example, better employers might offer employees a more exhaustive list of 401(k) investment options. The authors acknowledge this potential issue but cannot completely dismiss the concern.","",""

The authors’ estimated the program’s effects by comparing these groups’ employment, earnings, and recidivism outcomes one year after the program. Data were collected from probationer case files;, the Probation and Pretrial Services Automated Case Tracking System (PACTS) database;, and, for the treatment group, program records.

All participants who received vocational training were mandated to also complete either drug, alcohol, or mental health services. Although no probationers were turned away from participating in the program, those who were considered as having a moderate to high risk of probation failure and had at least one employment-related challenge were sought out for services.

The study used a regression model to compare the changes in the workplace injuries in single-facility manufacturing firms that had received an inspection that resulted in a penalty or citation to changes in firms that had not received a penalty or citation. The group of firms that had not received a penalty or citation combined two types of firms: firms that had not been inspected and firms that received inspections that did not result in a penalty or citation.
The study found that inspections that imposed penalties were associated with statistically significant reductions in the rates of all types of injuries examined. Among the specific citations studied, only citations for violating the general standard for personal protective equipment were associated with reduced injury rates.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this study is low. This means we are not confident that OSHA inspections that resulted in penalties or citations caused the reductions in workplace injuries.","","The study examined the effect of having an OSHA inspection that resulted in a penalty at any time during the preceding two years on the rates of different types of workplace injuries. It also examined the effect of having an OSHA inspection that resulted in a citation for a violation of specific OSHA standards (regardless of whether the violation was severe enough to result in a penalty) on workplace injury rates. The violations examined included those related to machine guarding, personal protective equipment, electrical wiring, forklift trucks, and fire extinguishers. Injuries were classified according to their relationship to OSHA standards: struck by, caught in, high fall, eye abrasion, and toxic exposure were classified as “more related to standards,” and exertion, struck against, and fall same level were classified as “less related to standards.”","The study used a regression model to compare the changes in the workplace injuries in single-facility manufacturing firms that had received an inspection that resulted in a penalty or citation to changes in firms that had not received a penalty or citation. The group of firms that had not received a penalty or citation combined two types of firms: firms that had not been inspected and firms that received inspections that did not result in a penalty or citation. For the analysis of specific citations, the study used a similar model to compare the changes in workplace injuries in manufacturing firms that had received an inspection that resulted in a citation for violations of OSHA standards to those firms that had not been inspected and firms that had received an inspection that did not result in a citation. The models included controls for changes in employment, industry, and year. The models did not distinguish between firms that were not inspected and those that were inspected but did not receive a penalty or citation.

The differences in injury rates could reflect underlying differences in safety levels or other factors between the firms being compared. For example, about 25 percent of the inspections examined in this study were triggered by a complaint of a workplace hazard. Therefore, the firms that received inspections likely had more underlying workplace hazards, on average, than firms that were not inspected. Similarly, firms that received a penalty or citation likely had more egregious safety violations than those that were inspected and did not receive a penalty or citation. In the absence of inspections, firms with more hazards and safety violations may have experienced different changes in injury rates as conditions deteriorated or because management would have made improvements to address unsafe working conditions.","",""

The authors used a nonexperimental design, matching youth who participated in the juvenile treatment court with similar court-involved youth who did not participate in the juvenile treatment court. The authors used administrative data to compare the mean number of juvenile rearrests for the study groups over a two-year follow-up period.
The study found that 53 percent of the treatment court group, compared with 73 percent of the comparison group, had a juvenile rearrest within 24 months. The study also found differences of a similar magnitude at three intermediate follow-ups (6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-ups).
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it was based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the juvenile treatment court, but other factors might also have contributed.","","The Anne Arundel Juvenile Treatment Court was an approximately 10-month-long program for juvenile offenders with substance use issues. Anne Arundel County, located in Maryland, is a suburb of Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. To be eligible for the program, the youth offender had to be charged with one of seven types of offenses and indicate that substance use contributed to the arrest. The offender also had to face significant family or school problems, and both the offender and his or her family had to be willing to participate in intensive treatment and related services as determined by the program.
A judge supervised treatment court participants. An interdisciplinary team of state and local agency representatives—including a treatment court coordinator, addiction treatment providers, prosecuting and defense attorneys, law enforcement officers, and parole and probation officers—supported the judge. The treatment court had three phases lasting a minimum of 5 months, with most participants remaining in the program for 10 months. In phase one, participants developed and began a treatment plan, attended treatment court reviews twice per month with a parent or guardian, attended school or General Educational Development (GED) classes, and attended group therapy. They faced a 5:00 p.m. curfew for the first two weeks of the program or until the first clean drug test and had to be substance–free for 30 days to move into phase two. In phase two, participants continued to attend school or GED classes, maintain employment (if not a full-time student), participate in individual and family counseling, and attend treatment court reviews twice per month, among other activities. In phase three, participants continued attending school or GED classes and/or maintained employment.
Participants received rewards or sanctions based on their performance and behavior throughout the program. Rewards included praise and encouragement from the treatment team, gift cards, less frequent court appearances, decreased drug testing, modified curfew, and release from probation (upon graduation). Sanctions included increased drug testing, essay-writing assignments, community service hours, book reports, curfew restrictions, and increased court appearances, among others.","The authors matched 168 juvenile treatment court participants with a comparison group of 102 similar juvenile offenders who received traditional court processing. To be eligible for potential inclusion in the comparison group, youth had to be younger than 18; residents of Anne Arundel County; have no history of violent offenses or drug trafficking; be under a moderate, high or intensive level of juvenile supervision; and have been arrested on at least one of the charges that made youth eligible for the treatment court. Treatment court participants were matched with potential comparison group members on demographic characteristics, type of charge for the eligible arrest, and criminal history. Most members of the study sample were male, white, and had been charged with a drug-related crime. Their average age was 16. To estimate the impact of the treatment court, the authors compared the mean number of rearrests, as documented in juvenile administrative records, of the two groups.","The study found that 53 percent of the treatment court group, compared with 73 percent of the comparison group, had a juvenile rearrest for any offense within 24 months. This difference was statistically significant. Differences of a similar magnitude were found at 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-ups.
The treatment court group had significantly fewer drug-related rearrests than the comparison group during the first 6 months after program entry, but differences were not statistically significant 12, 18, or 24 months after program entry.","The Department of Juvenile Services did not release the names of comparison group youth, so the study could not obtain adult criminal justice data for them. Because more than 90 percent of the treatment group (and, presumably, a similar proportion of the comparison group) became adults at some point during the two-year follow-up period, looking only at juvenile arrest records might not capture the full impact of the program.
In addition, youth and their families had to be willing to participate in the treatment court; therefore, treatment court participants might have been more motivated in general than control group youth. It is not clear how many control group youth decided not to participate in the program or were not offered the program.","",""

Offered in rural areas only, the PWP provided households with varying amounts of cash or food depending on the amount of work they contributed to public works projects. The PWP targeted households that have people who can work, who are food insecure and/or in poverty, and do not have another source of support.

Education (School participation/enrollment)
The study found a significant positive relationship between the program and school attendance. The program raised the probability of school attendance by 10 percentage points among children in a two-child family in rural areas, and by 0.5 percentage points in urban areas.
The Bolsa Escola program was significantly related to school progression. The program reduced the delay in school by 0.4 years among rural children in a two-child family and 0.115 years among urban children.","The study used data from the Brazilian Census to identify children who received the program. The Census question does not explicitly ask about participation in a named program. Rather, it asks if the child participates in a social program conditional on school enrollment. The authors assumed that the social program was Bolsa Escola.
Although the structural model controlled for the child’s age, gender, and household socioeconomic status, the authors did not account for child outcomes at baseline. The children might be enrolled in school prior to the intervention. Also, the families chose to participate in the program rather than being randomly assigned to the program. It is possible that unobservable factors, such as individual motivation to attend school, might have contributed to the estimated effects.","",""

[Texas ERA—Corpus Christi]","The study’s objective was to estimate the impact of pre- and post-employment job supports and intensive case management on welfare recipients’ employment and benefits receipt outcomes after four years. The Corpus Christi site was one of three in Texas that participated in the Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) project.
The authors randomly assigned 1,727 unemployed single-parent participants in Corpus Christi’s Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program to either a treatment group that received ERA services or a control group that received standard TANF services. The authors analyzed data from Unemployment Insurance (UI), TANF, and Food Stamps administrative records and a survey administered 12 months after random assignment.
The study found that, compared with the control group, those in the Corpus Christi ERA group were more likely to be employed at all or for four consecutive quarters in the fourth year after random assignment. Corpus Christi ERA group members also had higher earnings and received lower Food Stamps benefits.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is high because it was based on a well-conducted randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the ERA program and not to other factors.","","The ERA project was introduced in 1999 as a nationwide exploration of factors that help welfare recipients not only find employment but retain their positions and advance in their careers. Texas was one of 16 sites across the United States to receive funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to implement a program intended to improve welfare recipients’ employment outcomes. (The authors reported results for three sites in Texas, including Corpus Christi, separately, so CLEAR also reviewed the results for those sites separately.)
TANF recipients assigned to the Texas ERA program attended an initial orientation and then a four-day job search workshop. They then spent four to six weeks searching for jobs. The program assigned those who did not then secure employment to community service or volunteer positions. People who found jobs were eligible for a $200 monthly stipend for up to 12 months if they were employed for at least 30 hours per week, participated in a post-employment advancement activity, or left TANF; they were also eligible for the stipend if they worked 15 hours per week and participated in an education and training activity. The first four months of earnings for people in the program were disregarded when calculating their eligibility for the stipend. Texas ERA staff also helped clients with job-related problems, reemployment assistance, and support in meeting stipend requirements. Program staff made regular employer site visits. Participants were eligible for these services as long as they were eligible for the monthly stipend. Program staff coordinated case management services (including employment assessment, goal-setting and career planning, support services, barrier resolution, and job search assistance) across several partner agencies.","From October 2000 to January 2003, approximately 1,727 unemployed, single-parent TANF recipients were randomly assigned to either a treatment group, which received ERA services, or a control group, which received standard TANF services through the existing welfare-to-work “Choices” program. This program also provided case management and supportive services, but without the team-based approach used in ERA. Also in contrast to ERA, Choices case management services typically did not focus on long-range career goal-setting and planning.
The authors estimated employment and earnings impacts by comparing regression-adjusted UI wage records of treatment and control group members over the four years after random assignment. The authors also calculated program impacts for benefit receipt measures, including whether participants received TANF or Food Stamps, through four years after random assignment using TANF and Food Stamps administrative records.","The study found that, in the fourth year after random assignment, treatment group members were statistically significantly (p","The study authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to long-term benefit receipt.

The study was an expansion of an earlier randomized controlled trial (RCT). The author used survey data from the RCT taken before the program started (2000) and two years after (2002) to examine the probability and duration of child work.
The study found that the receipt of the cash transfer significantly reduced the probability that a child would work by approximately 10.6 percent and, for a child that was working, significantly reduced the hours worked per week by approximately 3.65 hours, on average.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Red de Protección Social program, and not to other factors.","Absence of conflict of interest.","The Nicaraguan government implemented the Red de Protección Social (RPS) conditional cash transfer program in 2000, in 42 eligible rural districts to alleviate poverty and encourage children to stay in school. Eligible districts were identified by ranking districts by four weighted poverty measures: average family size, percentage without piped water, percentage without a latrine, and percentage of individuals over five who are illiterate. Districts with the highest poverty index scores were eligible for inclusion in the program. Households in districts with children between the ages of 7-13 who had not yet completed fourth grade were eligible to receive an annual subsidy of $112 USD in exchange for mandatory school enrollment and an 85 percent attendance rate for all children in the household.","The original evaluation was randomized controlled trial (Maluccio & Flores, 2004). Using stratified random sampling, the 42 districts with highest poverty index scores were assigned to the treatment and control conditions (21 districts in each condition). Forty-two households were randomly selected from each of the 42 districts. Baseline survey data were collected on individuals, households, and districts in 2000, prior to implementation of the RPS program, with follow-up surveys in 2001 and 2002. The baseline sample included 1,764 households and 2,028 children aged 7-13 (979 in the treatment group and 1,049 in the control group). In the 2002 follow-up, there were 1,397 households and 1,702 children aged 9-15 (822 in the treatment group and 880 in the control group). Attrition at the child-level was 16 percent in both the treatment and control groups.
The current study used the baseline and the 2002 follow-up survey data to assess the program’s impact on children who were working. The author used regression analyses to assess the relationship between group assignment (treatment vs control) and the outcome variables (probability of work, number of hours worked per week). The regression model controlled for district (e.g., having secondary school), household (e.g., household size, expenditures), and child characteristics (e.g., age, gender, work at baseline).","Employment/Child labor
The study found that the offer of a conditional cash transfer subsidy significantly reduced the probability that a child would work by approximately 10.6 percent.
For children already working, the RPS program significantly reduced work hours by approximately 3.65 hours per child per week, on average.","There were errors in Table 2 (2002 follow-up) and Table 3, where the number of observations for the treatment and control groups were transposed. Working backwards from the levels of attrition reported (16% for both treatment and control), the 2000 baseline for the unit of analysis (children): 2,028 (total), 979 (treatment), 1,049 (control), and the attrition reported on Table 3 and occurring between 2000 and 2002: 326 (total), 157 (treatment), 169 (control), it can be determined that the 2002 sample was: 1,702 (total), 822 (treatment), 880 (control), resulting in low attrition for the study. Due to errors in Table 2, statistics in the findings section were extracted from the text rather than Table 2.","",""

It also aimed to promote long-term enhancement of resources and ability to earn income. The program consisted of three packages: 1) a basic conditional cash transfer (CCT) which was a $235 total payment plus an additional $25 per child conditional on regular school and health services attendance; 2) the basic CCT plus a scholarship for a household member to receive occupational training; and 3) the basic CCT plus a grant to the household to start a non-agricultural income-generating project. Households receiving the third package also had to develop a business plan and were provided with technical assistance and training.","The study was a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a CCT program on labor allocation in households with two or more children aged 6-15. Communities in six targeted municipalities were assigned by lottery to treatment or control groups (56 treatment and 50 control). Municipalities were targeted because they were both drought-affected and had high levels of rural poverty. Baseline data was used to identify eligible households within the communities based on the poverty and vulnerability scores.

The sample for this study includes all households with at least two children between the ages of 6 and 15 (1,597 households). At baseline, the households are poor with expenditures per family member around $250 USD per year; households included seven members on average of which approximately four were under age 15.

The ALP 052 course was intended to increase the number of students successfully passing ENGL 101 by answering student questions, practicing writing, and addressing grammar and punctuation. If the students passed both ALP 052 and ENGL 101, they could proceed to the next English course, ENGL 102. If they failed ENGL 101 but passed ALP 052, they had to retake ENGL 101. Likewise, if they failed both ENGL 101 and ALP 052, they had to either retake the ENGL 101 and ALP 052 combination or take the traditional ENGL 052 course (a developmental writing course). Because students in the ALP program did not have to take ENGL 052, they could finish their English requirement faster than students in the traditional course structure.","This nonexperimental study used college administrative data to measure impacts on courses attempted and passed, student persistence, and credits accrued. Multivariate linear regressions were used to measure impacts. The study included 2,174 students (104 treatment and 2,070 comparison) enrolled in either the ENGL 052 course or the coupled ALP 052 and ENGL 101 courses in fall 2007, spring 2008, or fall 2008.

This program also provided case management and supportive services, but without the team-based approach used in ERA.

The authors estimated the impact of antidiscrimination and reasonable accommodation laws using a differences-in-differences regression model with state- and year-fixed effects. Data were obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago’s Commercial Bank Database and from Global Insight.
The study found that neither antidiscrimination nor reasonable accommodation laws had a statistically significant effect on bank employment levels during the year the law went into effect or during the subsequent three years. Antidiscrimination laws led to a statistically significant 1.3 percent decline in bank employees’ average salary in the third year after enactment, but not in any other time period.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to state disability laws. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Antidiscrimination laws are those that prohibit employers from discriminating against applicants or employees on the basis of disability. Reasonable accommodation laws require that employers provide reasonable accommodations to help employees with disabilities complete the functions of their jobs, provided the accommodations do not impose undue hardship on the employer. Reasonable accommodations may include adjusting work schedules or equipment, providing qualified readers or interpreters, or modifying facilities to improve accessibility. States differ in how they define disability. By 1980, 38 states had enacted antidiscrimination laws and by 1990, almost all states had enacted such laws. Most also had some form of reasonable accommodation provision by 1990.","This study examined the effect of state antidiscrimination and reasonable accommodation laws for employees with disabilities at commercial banks in all 50 U.S. states from 1976 to 1988. The authors estimated a differences-in-differences regression with state- and year-fixed effects to measure the impact of state disability laws on the number of full-time equivalent employees and the average salary at the firm. Average salary was calculated as total salary plus bonuses paid divided by the number of full-time equivalent employees. The study looked at the effect of states having both antidiscrimination and reasonable accommodation laws and those having only antidiscrimination laws relative to having neither type of law. The authors considered effects at five points in time: the year before the relevant law went into effect, the year the law went into effect, and each of three years after the law went into effect. The authors estimated separate regressions for each outcome variable for each of these points in time. Control variables included time trends by state, an indicator for interstate banking legality, gross state product, and one- and two-year lagged values of the dependent variables.
To be eligible for inclusion in the study, banks must have reported 21 or more full-time employees and complete observations in all sample years. The number of banks in the sample ranged from 5,010 to 8,512 across sample years. Data on banks came from the Commercial Bank Database curated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Data on state economic factors were obtained from Global Insight, a private firm.","The study found that neither state antidiscrimination laws nor state reasonable accommodation laws had a statistically significant effect on commercial bank employment levels at any time from 1976 to 1988.
Antidiscrimination laws led to a statistically significant 1.3 percent decline in bank employees’ average salary in the third year after enactment, but not in any other time period.","The authors did not control for average characteristics of banks’ employees, such as disability status, gender, or race, and thus did not establish baseline comparability of banks that were and were not covered by state disability laws. If banks’ workforce profiles differed systematically across states, the outcomes of treatment and comparison banks might have reflected differences in workforce characteristics in addition to the effect of state disability laws.
It is also important to note that the authors conducted five regression analyses for each of four outcome variables without controlling for multiple comparisons. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. Thus the statistical significance of the average salary finding is likely overstated.","",""

The study took place at one unnamed research university. The authors compared the transition probabilities (that is, the probabilities of being hired, retained, or promoted) for men and women, before and during the period ADVANCE was in effect.
The study found that the ADVANCE program enhanced women’s representation among faculty in science and engineering departments.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is low. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the ADVANCE program. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Since 2001, the NSF has invested more than $130 million in support of ADVANCE programs nationwide1. These programs aim to increase the promotion and retention of women in academic science and engineering careers through interventions at institutions of higher education. The specific program components vary across institutions implementing them. The research university featured in this study adopted strategies to increase the transparency of the tenure-track promotion system, improve faculty recruitment practices, advance collaboration in research activities, and provide child care options for faculty.","The authors analyzed data on career transitions of tenured or tenure-track faculty in science and engineering departments from the university in question from 1998 to 2007. This encompassed 19 departments covering math, statistics, life sciences, agricultural sciences, natural resources, applied economics, and engineering. The authors estimated the probabilities of being hired, retained, and promoted, separately for men and women and different faculty ranks (assistant, associate, and full professor). They then compared the transition probabilities of women during ADVANCE with those of women before ADVANCE and men and women in both periods.","The study found that women experienced higher promotion probabilities under ADVANCE than they did before ADVANCE.
Women at the assistant professor rank had lower attrition under ADVANCE than they did before ADVANCE, but their counterparts at the full professor rank had higher attrition under ADVANCE.","The authors compared the transition rates of female science and engineering faculty before ADVANCE with those of female faculty while ADVANCE was in effect. However, it is not possible to attribute differences over this period to the ADVANCE program; the transition probabilities could reflect differences in female faculty representation over time that would have occurred even in the absence of ADVANCE.
The authors also compared the transition rates of women with those of men. These two groups differ fundamentally and there is no evidence that they experienced similar trends in their hiring, retention, and promotion rates in the pre-ADVANCE period. Therefore, comparing these rates during the ADVANCE period does not provide a test of what would have happened to women’s transition probabilities had the ADVANCE program not existed.
Finally, the authors also estimated some simulations projecting women’s and men’s representation on faculty using the baseline probabilities estimated in the first stage of their analysis. However, this type of analysis does not support causal inference.","","1 National Science Foundation. “ADVANCE at a Glance.” Available at http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/advance/."

The study used a nonexperimental design to compare labor and schooling outcomes of children who received the conditional cash transfer with a comparison group of children who did not, based on data from a survey.
The study found that receipt of the cash transfer was significantly associated with a decrease in the likelihood of participating in domestic work for urban children aged 10 to 17, a decrease in the hours spent in income-generating work for urban children aged 14 to 17, and a decrease in the hours spent in domestic work for all but rural children aged 14 to 17. Receipt of the cash transfer was also significantly related to an increase in the hours spent in school for all children in urban and rural areas.
The quality of causal evidence presented in the study is low because the authors did not control for pre-intervention outcomes. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Familias en Acción program; other factors are likely to have contributed.","Absence of conflict of interest.","The Familias en Acción program operates in Columbia and aims to alleviate poverty by providing financial subsidies for education, health, and nutrition. Eligible households receive a subsidy of $6.15 USD per child for primary school and $12.30 per child for secondary school. Children 7 to 17 years of age qualify for the program and subsidies are paid to the mother. The subsidy is conditional on attendance of 80 percent of classes. Mothers with children 0-6 are eligible to receive a monthly flat rate subsidy of $20.45 if they fulfill health care requirements including vaccinations, taking their children to growth and development check-ups, and attending courses on nutrition, hygiene, and contraception. In rural Columbia, the program has been operating since 2002.","Municipalities were eligible for the Familias en Acción program if they had a population of less than 100,000 individuals (not being a departmental capital), a bank, current welfare lists and other government documents, and basic health and education infrastructure. Households were eligible if they were in extreme poverty and had children under 18 years of age. Poverty was determined by a six-level indicator called SISBEN which is historically used to target households eligible for welfare programs (this program targeted SISBEN Level 1, extreme poverty). The study included a representative stratified sample of 122 municipalities (57 treatment and 65 comparison), stratified by region and infrastructure for education and health. Comparison municipalities satisfied eligibility requirements, except that they did not have a bank, and an effort was made to select areas that were similar in terms of population, area, and measures obtained from a quality of life index.
After the municipalities were chosen, approximately 100 households were randomly selected in each municipality for the treatment and comparison groups. In this study, the authors used a baseline survey conducted between June and October 2002 (n=11,500 households) and a follow-up survey conducted between July and November 2003 (n=10,742 households). In 26 of the 57 treatment municipalities, the baseline survey was conducted before the program started; however, knowledge of the program was widespread and registration had begun. In the other 31 areas, the baseline survey was conducted after the program started. Thus, the authors created early treatment (n=26 areas) and late treatment (n=31 areas) groups and only used the late treatment areas in analyses of work and schooling outcomes.
Child labor was measured by asking if the child participated in work (all work, income-generating, and domestic work) and the hours spent in work and school the day before the survey excluding Saturday and Sunday. The authors omitted children surveyed on Saturday and Sunday to avoid asking about weekend activities. Analyses were separated to determine program effects by location (urban or rural) and child age (10 to 13 or 14 to 17 years of age). The authors used statistical models with municipality, household, and individual controls to compare the outcomes of treatment and comparison group.","Employment/Child labor
The study found that receipt of the cash transfer was significantly associated with a decrease in the likelihood of participating in domestic work for urban children in both age groups. However, receipt of the cash transfer was not significantly associated with rates of domestic labor for rural children in either age group.
The study did not find a significant relationship between receipt of the cash transfer and rates of income-generating work (this includes work in the labor market and work in the family business).
The study found that receipt of the cash transfer was significantly associated with a decrease in the hours spent on income-generating work for urban children ages 14 to 17 years old. The program was not significantly related to hours spent on income-generating work for younger urban children, or rural children in either age group.
The study found that receipt of the cash transfer was significantly associated with a decrease in the hours spent on domestic work and the hours spent in total work for rural children ages 10 to 13 and for urban children in both age groups. The program was not significantly related hours spent on domestic work and the hours spent in total work for older rural children.
Education (School participation/enrollment)
• The study found that receipt of the cash transfer was significantly associated with an increase in the hours spent in school for all children in urban and rural areas.","The authors controlled for age, gender, and household education in the regression models but did not account for the outcomes at baseline, such as previous school attendance or child labor. These preexisting differences between the groups—and not the Familias en Acción program— could explain the observed differences in outcomes. Also, in 26 treatment municipalities, the baseline survey was conducted before the program started; however, knowledge of the program was widespread and registration had begun. The authors acknowledge that anticipation of the intervention was a problem in the late treatment group.","",""

This study was a randomized controlled trial that used student transcript data to compare the outcomes of treatment and control groups in the program semester and two subsequent semesters.
The study found that students assigned to the learning community treatment group were more likely to enroll in and complete a college success course in the program semester than those in the control group.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Learning Communities Demonstration at Hillsborough Community College, and not to other factors.","","The National Center for Postsecondary Research Learning Communities Demonstration was implemented in six community colleges across the United States from 2007 to 2009. It was designed to test whether learning communities were effective at improving academic performance among community college students in need of developmental courses. This study reported findings from the Learning Communities Demonstration at Hillsborough Community College in Tampa, Florida. At Hillsborough Community College, the learning communities program consisted of a developmental reading course linked with a college success course that taught students important skills for doing well in college. Within each of three cohorts (fall 2007, spring 2008, and fall 2008), learning community students enrolled in both courses together as a group, and faculty members were encouraged to collaborate and intergrate the curriculum across the two courses.","To be eligible to participate in the study, students had to be first-time students age 18 or over who placed into a developmental reading course. College staff told students who placed into developmental courses about the Learning Communities Demonstration and its eligibility requirements. Eligible students who agreed to participate filled out a baseline information form, received a $25 gift card as compensation for their time, and were randomly assigned to the treatment or control group. At the start of the study, the random assignment ration was 50:50, but during enrollment of the first wave of students in fall 2007, the random assignment ratio was changed to 67:33, meaning that students were twice as likely to be assigned to the treatment group than to the control group. Students in the treatment group were able to enroll in the learning communities program. Control group participants also had the opportunity to enroll in a developmental reading course and a college success course; however, the courses for the control students were not linked, and even those students who enrolled in both did not take the courses together with a specific cohort of students. The authors estimated regression models comparing the outcomes of treatment and control group members during the program semester and in two subsequent semesters, adjusting for cohort and campus and using weights to account for different random assignment ratios. The authors used transcript data provided by the college to measure the number of credits attempted and earned by students, successful completion of the learning community courses, and persistence as measured by continued enrollment.","The study found that in the program semester, students in the treatment group were 27 percentage points more likely to have attempted a college success course and 23 percentage points more likely to have completed a college success course than students in the control group. These differences were statistically significant.","The authors noted that the quality of the program improved over time. Data from faculty interviews and focus groups, as well as assessments of learning community course syllabi, indicated that linking and integration activities within learning community courses increased over the three semesters of the study. It is also worth noting that the authors conducted intent-to-treat analyses; however, only 69 percent of students randomly assigned to the treatment group actually enrolled in a learning community during the program semester. Finally, the study authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to progress toward degree completion. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","",""

About 1,100 9th-grade students from 11 high schools were randomly assigned to the treatment group, which could enroll in QOP, or the control group, which could not participate in QOP activities. The study team administered a survey to treatment and control group members at three follow-up periods to collect information on postsecondary educational attainment and labor market outcomes.
The report found few statistically significant impacts on the educational and employment-related outcomes examined.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this report for the analysis of the third follow-up period is high because it is based on a well-conducted randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that any impacts observed would be attributable to the QOP, not to other factors. However, the quality of causal evidence for the analyses of the other two follow-up periods is low.","Absence of conflict of interest: This study was conducted by staff from Mathematica Policy Research, which administers CLEAR. Therefore, the review of this study was conducted by an independent consultant trained in applying the CLEAR causal evidence guidelines.","QOP was an intensive program composed of case management and mentoring, education, developmental activities, community service, supportive services, and financial incentives. Services were provided year-round for up to five years to enrollees who had not yet graduated from high school. After high school graduation, participants received some continued mentoring and assistance applying to postsecondary education or training. According to the program model, case managers were to serve 15 to 25 students, and annual participation goals were 750 hours per enrollee who had not yet graduated from high school. For this evaluation, QOP was operated by seven community-based organizations, each affiliated with one to three high schools (11 high schools in total).
Eligibility requirements for students included being in 9th grade for the first time during the 1995–1996 academic year (except at one site, for which the relevant academic school year was 1996–1997) and being in the bottom two-thirds of the GPA distribution for their school in 8th grade. In addition, the students could not be so physically or learning disabled that, according to the school, the program was inappropriate for them.","Students who met eligibility requirements were randomly selected to be invited into the study. Those who consented (about 1,100) were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group. The treatment group was allowed to participate in QOP activities, whereas the control group was not. Participants in both groups were surveyed about one year after their scheduled graduation from high school—when they were entering their late teens—to collect information on their educational and labor market outcomes. High school transcripts for both groups were also collected.","The report found few statistically significant impacts on the educational and employment-related outcomes examined.
The exceptions were that, at the time of the third follow-up, QOP students were 7 percentage points more likely to have completed two years of college or training (37 versus 30 percent) and 7 percentage points more likely to have ever enrolled in postsecondary education (63 versus 56 percent) than control group members.","The analyses based on the third follow-up survey are based on a randomized controlled trial with low attrition and so received a high causal evidence rating. However, although based on the same trial, the study had high differential attrition across the study groups at the first and second follow-ups: the treatment group’s response rates to the surveys were substantially higher than the control group’s. This made the analyses based on these surveys ineligible to receive a high causal evidence rating. In addition, the analyses did not demonstrate equivalence of the two analytic groups on a measure of their financial disadvantage, which is required for studies reviewed in this topic area, nor did the analyses include a control for this characteristic. Therefore, the analyses of the first and second follow-ups could not receive a moderate causal evidence rating.
According to a related report (Schirm et al. 2006), the success of QOP implementation varied across the seven sites, and was not particularly well implemented in any sites. Two sites “deviated substantially” from the QOP model, whereas the other five “deviated moderately,” according to the study’s authors. Mentoring and developmental components were successfully implemented for the most part, but the education component was not effectively implemented and sites did not provide sufficient supportive services. Additionally, most enrollees participated in fewer activities than anticipated. These factors could help explain the lack of statistically significant findings.","Cleveland, Ohio

The authors use a nonexperimental design that uses key features of the Work First program to compare the employment and earnings of participants placed in temporary- or permanent-hire positions. Work First program participants are assigned to different local contractors in their district on a rotating basis. The contractors assist participants with job placement, but vary the emphasis they place on temporary-hire or direct-hire positions; the authors use this variation across contractors to compare the employment and earnings of participants in different types of job placement.
The study found that the average employment probability and quarterly earnings of those who found a direct-hire job increased significantly in the eight quarters following program participation compared with that of those who found a temporary-help job.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it is based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design.

Temporary-help positions offer quick entry into paid employment but typically only last a short period of time. Direct-hire positions are considered a typical job that any individual on the job market could obtain.","The study included a sample of 37,163 participants assigned to the Work First program from 1999 to 2003 in Detroit. The average age of participants was 30 years old; 94 percent of participants were female and 97 percent African American. The comparison group consisted of those assigned to Work First but were unable to find either a temporary-help or a direct-hire job placement.
The authors used Michigan Unemployment Insurance records and data from the Work First program to compare the employment and earnings of those who were placed in a temporary-hire job placement with those who were placed in a direct-hire job position; the authors also compared those who were placed in either a temporary- or direct-hire position with those who were enrolled in the Work First program but were unable to find employment during the first seven quarters after program participation.","Earnings. Work First participants placed in direct-hire jobs significantly increased their average quarterly earnings by $493 from quarters two to eight after contractor assignment. By comparison, the effect of temporary-job placement on earnings was not significant from quarters two to eight. In additional, the average quarterly earnings of those who found a job (either temporary- or direct-hire), compared with that of those who were assigned to the Work First program but were unable to find a job were significantly higher from quarters two to eight following program assignment ($248).
Employment. The study found that the average probability of being employed from quarters two to eight following program assignment increased significantly by 15 percentage points for those who were placed in direct-hire positions. Conversely, the study found that temporary-hire placement did not significantly increase the average probability of being employed from quarters two and eight following program assignment.","The study examined 37,163 Work First participants; however, the sample only included 24,903 unique participants, as many participants enrolled in the program multiple times. Participants who enrolled multiple times in the Work First program might have behaved differently from those who enrolled for the first time, and this could affect observed earnings and employment outcomes.
The authors attempted to account for the motivation of participants to find work in their statistical analysis using an instrumental variable approach. However, because the participants were Temporary Assistance for Needy Families recipients who were required to meet minimum employment requirements to receive the benefit—but might lose the benefit if they became employed in a well-paying job—the authors’ analysis might not fully account for the participants’ motivations to seek temporary positions.","",""

This summary focuses on the comparison between the treatment group receiving the basic CCT and the control group.
The study was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in northwest Nicaragua. The authors analyzed data from a household survey given at baseline and nine months into the program. The authors compared household allocation of child labor by age and gender of children in households with two or more children.
The study found that in households receiving the basic CCT, economic labor significantly decreased for boys but not girls. Boys decreased their hours per week in economic work (including agricultural, livestock, and non-agricultural economic activity) by 1.1 hours compared to girls. Older boys aged, 10-15, also showed a larger, significant reduction in economic work of 3.0 hours a week compared to their siblings.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial with low attrition. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to Atención a Crisis, and not to other factors.","Absence of conflict of interest.","Atención a Crisis was implemented by the government between November 2005 and December 2006 in six municipalities affected by a severe drought and classified as extremely poor in northwest Nicaragua. The conditional cash transfer program’s goal was to serve as a short-term safety net for families experiencing poverty and reducing ""adverse coping mechanisms"" such as selling resources or pulling children out of school. It also aimed to promote long-term enhancement of resources and ability to earn income. The program consisted of three packages: 1) a basic conditional cash transfer (CCT) which was a $235 total payment plus an additional $25 per child conditional on regular school and health services attendance; 2) the basic CCT plus a scholarship for a household member to receive occupational training; and 3) the basic CCT plus a grant to the household to start a non-agricultural income-generating project. Households receiving the third package also had to develop a business plan and were provided with technical assistance and training.","The study was a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a CCT program on labor allocation in households with two or more children aged 6-15. Communities in six targeted municipalities were assigned by lottery to treatment or control groups (56 treatment and 50 control). Municipalities were targeted because they were both drought-affected and had high levels of rural poverty. Baseline data was used to identify eligible households within the communities based on the poverty and vulnerability scores. In the treatment communities, 3,000 households were identified as eligible and were assigned by lottery to one of the three treatment conditions (1,000 each). From a random sample of 1,100 households in the control communities, 1,000 households were also identified as eligible using the same methodology to measure poverty and vulnerability to serve as the control group. During the study period the scholarships were delayed so the first and second treatment conditions consisted of the basic CCT only.
The sample for this study includes all households with at least two children between the ages of 6 and 15 (1,597 households). At baseline, the households are poor with expenditures per family member around $250 USD per year; households included seven members on average of which approximately four were under age 15. Households had very little education (less than three years on average) and most households (90%) were self-employed in agriculture. Boys (6-15) worked 4.5 hours a week in economic activities and girls (6-15) 2.1 hours. Older children (10-15) worked 5.8 hours a week in economic activities, while children 6-10, worked only 1.3 hours in economic activities.
Survey data were collected at baseline and nine months into the program. Child labor outcomes included the number of hours worked per week in economic activities (non-agriculture, agriculture, and livestock), chores, and domestic labor. Using an intent-to-treat approach, the study analyzed the differences in intra-household labor allocations between treatment households receiving the basic CCT only and the control households using statistical models.","Employment/Child labor
The evaluation found that boys in the treatment households significantly reduced participation in economic work by 1.1 hours a week compared to girls.
Older boys, aged 10-15, showed a further significant reduction in economic work by 3.0 hours a week compared to their siblings.
The receipt of the basic CCT was not significantly related to economic work for girls.","After randomization, based on conversations with community leaders, 3.7 percent of households in the treatment communities deemed eligible were moved to non-eligible and 3.7 percent of households deemed non-eligible were moved to eligible. To prevent this from biasing the results, the researchers analyzed the data as ""intent-to-treat"" and analyzed those households as part of their originally assigned groups. The study includes domestic work and chores as part of the aggregate measure of child labor which are excluded here because they are not part of CLEAR’s definition of child labor. Results reported are for economic labor only.","",""

The study found a statistically significant relationship between the amount of child care subsidies and single mothers’ full-time employment. The study did not find relationships between child care subsidies and other employment outcomes examined.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the author did not account for existing differences between the mothers who did and did not receive the child care assistance. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the child care subsidies; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The child care subsidies examined in this study were for single mothers with children younger than 13 receiving child care assistance through the CCDF. The amount of the child care subsidies varied based on the age of the child, the parent’s level of employment, family income, and the state or county welfare agency providing the subsidies. The subsidies also varied by year within a state because of changes in state policies. The subsidies were given in the form of vouchers to be used toward child care at a licensed facility or provider. Of the mothers who received a child care subsidy from the welfare agency, the average amount of the subsidy was $479.80.","The study included a sample of 30,300 single mothers with children younger than 13 identified through the Current Population Survey (CPS) from 2001 to 2007.

The author defined the child care subsidy as the difference between the child care reimbursement rate and the family copayment rate. The author used the Urban Institute’s Welfare Rules Database to capture state-level measures of work-related requirements and the welfare environment.

Thus, the analysis cannot receive a moderate evidence rating. In addition, it was unclear how the author selected the sample from the CPS and whether the treatment condition as defined by the author varied at the state or individual levels. Furthermore, information presented in the report suggested that members of the comparison group received child care subsidies of similar amounts to those received by the treatment group. Attempts to reach the author to clarify these issues were unsuccessful.","",""

This study is an intent-to-treat regression discontinuity design. Data were collected from applications at all 100 CSP schools, as well as from household surveys at five randomly selected schools and households in five provinces, eighteen months after application. The cutoff score that was used to decide who would receive the scholarship offer was based on the application forms; 26 questions correlated with how likely the child was to drop out of school. Enrollment and work outcomes were compared for students around the cutoff score who did, and did not, receive a scholarship offer and their siblings.
The study found children who received the scholarships were significantly more likely to be enrolled in school and less likely to work for pay than those that did not receive the scholarship. However, girls that received the scholarships were significantly more likely to work without pay.
This study uses a regression discontinuity design and therefore was reviewed using CLEAR’s descriptive study evidence review guidelines. As such it does not receive a causal rating.","Absence of conflict of interest.","At the time of the study, the CSP was in place in 100 of 800 middle schools in Cambodia. The 100 schools receiving the CSP were selected based on poverty rates which correlated with lower school enrollment. Schools that had a similar type of scholarship program already in place were not eligible to be CSP schools. All schools that fed into the CSP middle schools were identified and all sixth graders were asked to complete an application form for the CSP, resulting in over 26,000 applications. The applications were scored based on a constructed index that indicated how likely the students would be to drop out. Within each CSP school, the applications were ranked and either the bottom 50 or bottom 30 students received a scholarship offer, depending on the size of the school. The scholarships for 7th, 8th and 9th grade were equivalent to about 2-3 percent of household expenditures a year, and was awarded three times a year by the school principal at a public ceremony. In the year of this study, about 3,800 scholarships were offered.","The authors used a regression discontinuity design (RDD) comparing those that were offered the scholarships to those that had no more than 35 student ranking places above the cut-off score. They used statistical models to look at impacts on the probability of school enrollment, working for pay, and working without pay, and the number of hours engaged in each those three activities. The models included several variables such as school level, age, birth order, gender, siblings, and the interaction between gender and sibling. Data was from the initial scholarship applications, as well as a follow-up household survey 18 months later of randomly selected schools and 3,453 randomly selected applicants from five provinces (Battambang, Kampong Thom, Kratie, Prey Veng, and Takeo). Final regression sample sizes were 8,182, including all children ages 7-18.","Employment/Child labor
The study found boys who received the scholarship were 12 percentage points less likely work for pay than boys that did not receive the scholarship. No statistically significant effect was found for boys working without pay.
The study found girls who received the scholarship were 9 percentage points less likely to work for pay than girls that did not receive the scholarship. However, girls receiving the scholarship were 7 percentage points more likely to work without pay.
Siblings in households who received the scholarship, but were not eligible to participate, did not show any statistically significant impacts on child labor.
Children receiving the scholarship worked 1-3 hours less per week than children that did not receive the scholarship.

The analysis was based on administrative data on employees’ demographic characteristics and 401(k) contributions. The study analyzed changes in outcomes that occurred when a firm began requiring employees to choose the funds to which the employer’s 401(k) matching contributions would be allocated. 
The study found that allowing employees to choose the asset allocation of their matched contributions reduced contributions to employer stock by 64 percentage points in the first year of the new policy. The study also found that employees’ own contribution allocations did not change significantly after the policy was enacted, suggesting that employees made their personal allocation decisions without considering the employer’s match allocation.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the active-decision requirement for employer matched contributions. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","","","The study found that employees who enrolled after March 2003 allocated, on average, 64 percentage points less of the employer match to employer stock in 2003 and 59 percentage points less in 2004 than those who enrolled before March 2003. 
Employees across both groups allocated nearly the same percentage of their own contributions to employer stock, evidence that employees made their personal allocation decisions without considering the employer match allocation.
The year-end balance of matched contributions held in employer stock was 66 to 68 percentage points lower for employees hired after March 2003. The fraction of individual contributions held in employer stock was 2 to 4 percentage points lower for the intervention group.","The study showed that individual 401(k) contributions to employer stock declined from about 60 percent in 1998 to about 20 percent in early 2003 (before the policy change) and that year-end balances of individual allocations in employer stock had declined by about the same magnitude over the period. Thus, there is some reason to believe that the change in the company’s 401(k) plan was a result of declining employee investment in employer stock. In addition, the study examined the policy change at only one point in time. This makes it difficult to conclude that the observed changes in outcomes were driven by the intervention itself, instead of other concurrent changes (for example, changes in market conditions).","",""

Participants were randomly assigned to a treatment group, which was eligible for the more generous work incentive, or a control group that was not. The authors examined impacts on employment and earnings using state unemployment insurance (UI) wage records.
The study found that, although BOPD achieved no statistically significant impacts on being employed, it did generate some positive impacts on earnings at the first year after random assignment.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this report is high for the year two impacts. This means we are confident that those estimated effects are attributable to the BOPD. However, the quality of the causal evidence for the year one impacts is moderate. This means we have confidence that the effects are attributable at least in part to the BOPD, but other factors might also have contributed.","","Administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA), the BOPD was a pilot test of the later Benefit Offset National Demonstration. The primary intervention was a benefit offset that replaced the so-called cash cliff SSDI recipients who work eventually experience. The cash cliff refers to the fact that SSDI recipients who have completed a nine-month trial work period followed by a three-month grace period have all their SSDI benefits suspended or terminated if they earn more than a threshold amount known as substantial gainful activity (SGA). The benefit offset replaces the complete loss of all benefits for working SSDI recipients, instead gradually withdrawing the SSDI benefit by $1 for every $2 earned above the SGA amount.
BOPD was implemented in four states: Connecticut, Utah, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Apart from recruiting SSDI recipients who received benefits solely based on their own earnings records, had completed a trial work period within the past 72 months, and were not concurrently receiving Supplemental Security Income benefits, the states were free to select their own program eligibility criteria. Connecticut recruited potential participants statewide from the state Medicaid Buy-In program, SSA benefits counseling program, and vocational rehabilitation program. Of the 6,726 Connecticut residents contacted to participate in the BOPD, 887 responded to the initial solicitation. Ultimately, only 265 were found eligible, consented to participate, and were enrolled in the demonstration.","The BOPD in Connecticut was evaluated using a randomized controlled trial. Connecticut SSDI recipients deemed eligible for the pilot were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which received the benefit offset, or the control group, which received services as usual. Both groups remained eligible to receive benefits counseling and other standard services.
The authors analyzed data from state UI wage records. The key outcome variables were quarterly employment rates, earnings, and an indicator of earnings in excess of the SGA level. The authors estimated impacts on employment and earnings outcomes for the two research groups for eight quarters (two years) after enrollment.","The study found no statistically significant impacts on employment rates one and two years after random assignment.
The study found statistically significant, positive impacts on average quarterly earnings at the first year following random assignment. However, this impact was not present at the end of year two.
Treatment group members were more likely than control group members to have earnings in excess of the SGA amount at one (37 versus 16 percent) and two years (28 versus 16 percent) after random assignment.","The volunteers who participated in the BOPD are not likely to be representative of the larger SSDI recipient population because they were typically recruited from organizations that helped clients obtain employment, and are therefore likely to be representative of the 20 percent of SSDI recipients who report an expectation of returning to work. In addition, the decision by SSA to restrict eligibility to SSDI recipients who completed their trial work period within the past 72 months disqualified potential participants with longer work histories; these people might have benefited the most from the program.","",""

Three-year effects of an enhanced student services program at two community colleges","The study’s objective was to examine the impact of the Opening Doors program at Lorain County Community College and Owens Community College in Ohio. The Opening Doors program at these schools provided students with enhanced counseling services and a modest stipend for two semesters.
The study was a randomized controlled trial. Eligible students were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which was eligible to receive Opening Doors counseling services and a stipend, or the control group, which was not offered these services. The primary data sources were a baseline survey on the background characteristics of students, students’ transcripts from the two colleges, and degree attainment information from the National Student Clearinghouse. The study reported outcomes for the two program semesters and four post-program follow-up semesters.
The study found that cumulatively from the first program semester to the third follow-up semester, the treatment group registered for significantly more semesters and earned significantly more developmental credits than the control group. There was no significant difference in the proportion of treatment group students who completed a degree or certificate relative to the control group.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects would be attributable to the Opening Doors program, and not to other factors.","","The Opening Doors program at Lorain County Community College in Elyria, Ohio, and Owens Community College in Toledo, Ohio, involved the provision of enhanced counseling services over two semesters. Participants in the treatment group were assigned a counselor and were expected to meet with the counselor at least twice a semester to discuss academic progress and any school-related issues. Each counselor assigned to the treatment group had a smaller caseload (one counselor for every 81 and 157 treatment group students at Lorain and Owens, respectively) than counselors in the control group (one counselor for more than 1,000 students). The smaller caseload for Opening Doors counselors was intended to provide more intense and frequent contacts with students. In addition to the counseling services, participants assigned to the treatment group received a $150 stipend in both program semesters. Participants also had access to study groups with the counselors and tutoring sessions around midterm and final exams. The program operated at both colleges from fall 2004 through spring 2006.
To participate in the Opening Doors program, students had to be incoming freshman or have completed fewer than 13 credits, be ages 18 to 34, have family income below 250 percent of the federal poverty level, hold a high school diploma or general education development certificate, and not already hold an associate’s degree from an accredited college or university.","This study was a randomized controlled trial, and randomization occurred at the student level. Eligible students who consented to participate in the study filled out a baseline data form. Then, the students were randomized either to the treatment group, which was offered the opportunity to receive Opening Doors counseling services and a stipend, or the control group, which could not receive Opening Doors services, but could access existing college services. Across both schools, there were 2,139 students in the study with 1,073 in the treatment group and 1,066 in the control group.
The authors used data from the baseline data form, students’ transcripts, and the National Student Clearinghouse to measure outcomes related to progress toward degree completion. Impacts were reported as the difference of means between the treatment and control groups, adjusted for the semester of random assignment and college. This study reported outcomes for six semesters: the two program semesters and four subsequent follow-up semesters.","The program group registered for 0.2 more semesters than the comparison group and earned 0.4 more developmental credits than the comparison group, over the cumulative period from the first program semester through the third post-program semester. Both of these differences were statistically significant.
In the first program semester, the program group earned 0.2 more developmental credits than the control group. This difference was statistically significant, but there were not any other significant differences between the program and control groups on course registration, credits attempted and earned, and grade point average during the first program semester. Additionally, the course withdrawal rate during the first program semester was 3.8 percentage points higher for the treatment group than the control group. In the second program semester, there were multiple significant positive findings: the course registration rate for treatment group members was 7 percentage points higher than the control group, and treatment group members attempted 0.7 more credits and earned 0.5 more credits than the control group. However, these differences did not persist across the three post-program semesters. Although the treatment-group attempted an average of 0.4 more credits than the control group in the third post-program semester, there were no significant differences observed in any of the three post-program semesters on course registration or credits earned.
There was no significant difference between the treatment and control groups on the proportion of students who completed a degree or certificate over the cumulative period from the first program semester through the third post-program semester.","The authors noted that the Opening Doors program was implemented more intensively at Lorain County Community College than at Owens Community College. The counselors at Lorain had smaller caseloads and a higher proportion of treatment students at Lorain received one or more of their stipend payments (93 percent), compared with treatment students at Owens (86 percent), which might suggest that program uptake was higher at Lorain.
The study authors estimated multiple impacts on outcomes related to persistence toward completing a college degree. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in this domain is likely to be overstated.","",""

This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to either direct or indirect EEOC enforcement; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, employers are forbidden from discriminating against their employees on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, or national origin. The law prohibits discrimination in terms, compensation, working conditions, and other aspects of employment. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 created the EEOC to enforce Title VII. Employees who believed they had experienced employment discrimination could file claims against their employers through this commission, which was empowered to investigate the allegations and arbitrate settlements. If investigators substantiated claims, the EEOC could have required employers to pay monetary benefits to complainants or to improve workplace policies or conditions.","The author used fixed-effects regressions to examine a longitudinal sample of 2,166 establishments that filed EEO-1 Employer Information Reports from 1990 to 2002. Private establishments with at least 100 employees and federal contractors with at least 50 employees were required to submit these reports annually to the EEOC and the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. The outcome variable was a dissimilarity index that measured the extent to which two given groups of workers were distributed differently across occupational categories within an establishment. The analysis assessed the effects of enforcement activities on this measure of occupational segregation.
To evaluate the effects of direct EEOC enforcement, the author included variables that measured the number of race or sex discrimination charges against each establishment in each year, the dollar amount each establishment paid in each year to settle discrimination suits, and binary variables indicating whether each establishment received a mandate to change its employment policies or was involved in a class-action claim in each year. Analogous variables for each industry in each year captured the effect of being in an industry with greater EEOC enforcement. The models included fixed effects for each establishment and industry and controlled for organizational characteristics that could vary over time, such as size and minority representation in management, as well as characteristics of the legal environment, such as whether the establishment was a federal contractor or located in a progressive judicial circuit. In some specifications, effects of enforcement variables were allowed to differ by establishment characteristics.","The study found that every additional settlement mandating a policy change within an industry and every additional dollar of monetary settlements within an industry were associated with a statistically significant decrease in sex segregation within establishments in the industry, but had limited effects on race segregation.
Direct discrimination charges and sanctions had no statistically significant effect on race or gender segregation.
Larger monetary settlements reduced sex segregation significantly more among federal contractors than among noncontractors and more among smaller than larger establishments.","This study sought to quantify the effect of enforcement activities on occupational segregation by associating changes in segregation with EEOC claims and settlements. Employment establishments and industries with a predisposition to discriminate might face more charges and enforcement activities, suggesting that establishments and industries that experience fewer charges are not inherently comparable to establishments or industries that face more. The inclusion of establishment-level fixed effects do not completely address this problem because the author does not discuss any evidence that a predisposition to discriminate is a fixed characteristic (for instance, by comparing trends between establishments that ultimately face low and high levels of enforcement). Although EEOC enforcement activities, direct or indirect, contributed to the estimated change in occupational segregation, an establishment’s predisposition to discriminate may have contributed as well; therefore, the study’s estimates do not represent the effect of enforcement alone.","",""

Using survey data from a cluster randomized controlled trial, the authors analyzed the average program impact of the PROGRESA/Oportunidades program using a difference-in- differences (DID) regression model for the child labor outcome and cross-sectional models to estimate spillover effects on child labor.
The study found the number of children aged 12-16 who worked significantly decreased in cash transfer participating households compared to control households.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is high because it is based on a well-implemented, low attrition randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to PROGRESA/Oportunidades and not to other factors.","Absence of conflict of interest.","Beginning in 1997, the PROGRESA/Oportunidades program has provided monthly conditional cash transfers, which is approximately 20 percent of the average total household income. By 2012 the program had served 5.8 million households in Mexico. The cash transfer is conditional upon child school attendance (85% of days) for children aged 8-17, and health clinic visits for household members, as well as the requirement for pregnant women and lactating women to take nutritional supplements and go to five pre-natal visits. The amount of the cash transfer varies by gender and increased with the grade of the child. However, if a child repeats a grade twice, he or she will permanently lose the cash transfer.","The study used survey data from a randomized controlled trial across rural communities in 7 states in Mexico (320 in treatment and 186 in control). Poor households, based on a marginality index, were selected to participate in the program. In this study, the authors used the 1997 baseline survey of Household Socio-Economic Conditions and information from the third follow-up survey (administered in November, 1999).
To test the impact of PROGRESA/Oportunidades program on work, the authors analyzed household-level outcomes for children aged 8-17 at baseline. Outcomes included whether the child participated in paid or unpaid work (excluding domestic chores) in the week prior to the survey. The author disaggregated the findings according to four age bands based on the age eligibility requirements and to understand differences in primary to secondary school children (ages 8-17, 8-16, 12-17, and 12-16). The author estimated impacts using difference-in-differences regression models, including controls for household characteristics.","Employment/Child labor
For children aged 12-16, the number of children who worked significantly decreased in participating households compared to control households.
The study found no statistically significant relationship between PROGRESA and child labor for the additional age bands: 8-17, 8-16, 12-17.","","",""

Active-decision enrollment was compared with standard enrollment, which required employees to opt in to a 401(k) plan.
The analysis was based on administrative data on enrollment in and contributions to a retirement plan. The study analyzed changes in outcomes before and after the change from active-decision to standard enrollment.
The study found that requiring employees to actively opt in or out of savings plans increased 401(k) participation and contribution rates, compared with standard enrollment. The study also found that employees who participated in the 401(k) plan under the active-decision enrollment policy contributed less, on average, than participants under standard enrollment. 
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the company’s active-decision enrollment policies. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","","","The study found that the average 401(k) enrollment rate for employees three months after hire in the active-decision cohort was 28 percentage points higher than for the standard enrollment group. This difference fell to 17 percentage points when employees had been at the firm for 24 months and 5 percentage points when they had achieved 42 months of tenure (the differences remained statistically significant).
Under active-decision enrollment, new employees contributed 1.2 percentage points more of their income, on average, after nine months of tenure than new employees under the standard enrollment scheme.
Among 401(k) participants only, the contribution rate of the active-decision group was lower than that of the standard enrollment group until employees had reached 40 months of tenure.","The change from active-decision to standard enrollment was implemented only once and at a single company.

Using panel survey data collected before and one year after program implementation, the author measured the impact of RPS using a randomized controlled trial (RCT).
The study found that participation in RPS was significantly related to a reduction in child labor and a significant increase in school enrollment and attendance.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this report is low because, while it was based on an RCT, attrition was high and the authors did not demonstrate that the groups were similar at baseline. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Red de Proteccion Social; other factors are likely to have contributed.","Absence of Conflict of Interest.","The Red de Proteccion Social (RPS) was a pilot government program to reduce both current and future poverty via cash transfers to households living in extreme poverty in rural Nicaragua. The transfers were conditional on school attendance and promotion to the next grade. The objectives of the program were to supplement the household income for up to three years to increase expenditures for food, increasing healthcare, and nutritional status of children under age 5, and reducing school dropout during the first four years of school (cash transfer equivalent to $112 USD annually in 2000).","Creation of the treatment and control groups occurred in three stages of geographic targeting. First, two departments (i.e., administrative or political subdivisions) were selected based on need and capacity to implement the program, including existing education and health facilities. Second, six municipalities within the departments were chosen based on poverty level and capacity to participate in the pilot program. Finally, 42 localities within the municipalities were selected using a marginality index based on 1995 National Population and Housing Census data. Localities were rank ordered by a marginality index then stratified into seven groups of six localities each. From each group, three localities were randomly selected into the treatment group, while the remaining three localities served as controls, resulting in 21 treatment localities and 21 control localities. All households in the treatment group received a $224 USD cash transfer annually; families with children ages 7 to 13 who had not completed the fourth grade received an additional $133 USD annually for a school attendance and school supplies transfer. The control group did not receive the cash transfers.
Data were obtained through a household level panel survey. At baseline, the survey was administered to a stratified random sample of 1,585 households, approximately 13 percent of the household population in the study area. A follow-up survey was also conducted to the original baseline households, re-interviewing 1,494 households.
The purpose of the analysis was to assess whether there were differences between the treatment and the control groups due to the RPS on child labor, and school attendance and enrollment for children 7 to 13 years of age.","Employment/Child labor
The study found a statistically significant relationship between the RPS program and a reduction in child labor. When compared to control group children, there was a significant reduction in the percentage of children working (9-percentage point difference) for RPS participating children ages 10 to 13.
Education (School participation/enrollment)
The study found a statistically significant relationship between the RPS program and an increase in school enrollment. When compared to control group children, there was a significant increase in the percentage of RPS participating children enrolled in school (22-percentage point difference).
The RPS was also significantly associated with an increase in school attendance, with an average 29-percentage point difference between the treatment and control group.","The original study was a randomized controlled trial with high attrition, which affected the treatment and control groups’ comparability on background characteristics that could have affected the causal outcomes of interest; CLEAR reviews the study as a regression analysis. The authors also did not report tests of baseline equivalence on the control variables. There is also no explanation as to how the localities were stratified into the seven groups before randomization into the treatment or control groups. Another consideration was the potential for measurable changes in localities due to the novelty of the program, or Hawthorne Effect, which may inflate the impact of the RPS on the treatment localities.","",""

The Opening Doors program offered students with dependent children a performance-based $1,000 scholarship in each of two semesters. The study examined both the shorter- and longer-term impacts of the Opening Doors program using different cohorts of students.
The study was a randomized controlled trial. Eligible students were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which was offered the opportunity to receive the scholarship, or the control group, which was not eligible for the scholarship. The primary data sources were a baseline survey on the background characteristics of students, student transcripts, and degree attainment information from the National Student Clearinghouse.
The study found that for all four cohorts of students, the treatment group was significantly more likely to have registered for any course and have enrolled full-time in college, and to have attempted and earned significantly more credits in both the first and second program semesters, compared with the control group. The study found that for the first two cohorts of students, the treatment group registered for classes at a higher rate, enrolled in more semesters of college, and earned more credits than the control group cumulatively through the fourth semester after random assignment.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Opening Doors program, and not to other factors.","","At Delgado Community College and Louisiana Technical College-West Jefferson in New Orleans, Louisiana, the Opening Doors program involved a performance-based scholarship of $1,000 that participants were eligible to receive in each of two semesters. The scholarship was payable directly to the students in three installments each semester: $250 for enrolling in at least six credit hours; $250 after completing midterms, having passing grades in all classes, and staying enrolled in at least six credit hours; and $500 for completing six or more credit hours with a C average or better. Program counselors monitored students’ performance at each payment benchmark and physically handed checks to qualified students at the beginning, middle, and end of each semester. Students could earn the scholarship in two semesters, which could be back-to-back or nonconsecutive semesters. The scholarship was offered in addition to Pell Grant and other financial aid that the students might have been receiving, and did not substitute for those sources. The Opening Doors program enrolled students in the spring 2004, summer 2004, fall 2004, and spring 2005 terms.
To be eligible to participate in the Opening Doors program, students had to be ages 18 to 34, be parents with at least one dependent child younger than 19 years old, have a household income less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level, hold a high school diploma or a general educational development certificate or have passed all college entrance exams, and not already have earned a college degree or certificate.","This study was a randomized controlled trial. Randomization occurred at the student level, separately for each cohort. Eligible students who consented to participate in the study filled out a baseline data form. Then, the students were randomized either to the treatment group, which was offered the opportunity to participate in the Opening Doors program, or the control group, which could not participate in the program, but could access existing college services.
The study reported shorter-term outcomes from the two program semesters for the full sample of all four student cohorts: spring 2004, summer 2004, fall 2004, and spring 2005. In total, there were 1,019 students in the four cohorts, with 505 in the treatment group and 514 in the control group. For the first two cohorts of students, which were enrolled in spring 2004 and summer 2004, the study also reported longer-term outcomes for four semesters: the two program semesters and two subsequent follow-up semesters. There were 537 students in the first two cohorts, with 264 in the treatment group and 273 in the control group.
The authors used data from the baseline data form, students’ transcripts, and the National Student Clearinghouse for outcomes related to progress toward degree completion. Impacts were reported as the difference of means between the treatment and control groups, adjusted for cohort and school campus.","For the first two cohorts, the study found that, cumulatively, across the two program semesters and two follow-up semesters, the treatment group was 6.5 percentage points more likely to be registered for any courses than the control group The treatment group enrolled in 0.4 more semesters of college and earned 3.5 more credits than the control group cumulatively across the four semesters. All of these differences were statistically significant.
For all four cohorts, the study found that the treatment group was 5.3 percentage points more likely to register for any course in the first program semester and 15.0 percentage points more likely to do so in the second program semester. The study also found that the treatment group was 6.4 percentage points more likely to enroll in college in the first program semester and 15.3 percentage points more likely to enroll in college in the second program semester, compared with the control group. The treatment group attempted 0.6 more credits in the first program semester and 1.2 more credits in the second program semester, compared with the control group. The treatment group earned 1.2 more total credits in the first semester and 1.1 more total credits in the second program semester, compared with the control group. These differences were statistically significant.","When Hurricane Katrina struck in August of 2005, both colleges closed temporarily and many students moved away, which shortened available follow-up. Although the authors did report some post-Katrina outcomes, this review does not focus on those findings given the difficulties in measuring program impacts in the aftermath of a natural disaster.
Program implementation differed in the summer semesters compared with the regular school year semesters at Delgado. In summer 2004, there were only two scholarship payment installments, rather than three; in summer 2005, students were offered a $500 scholarship if they completed one three-hour course, rather than the typical expectation of completing at least six credit hours.
The study authors estimated multiple impacts on outcomes in the progress toward degree completion and actual completion of a degree domains. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in this domain is likely to be overstated.","",""

The objective was to understand how YouthBuild programming for young offenders was designed and implemented; identify the strategies and approaches associated with positive outcomes; and gain insight into the contextual factors influencing program implementation and participant performance.
The authors collected and analyzed qualitative information gathered during two rounds of site visits—which included interviews with program staff, instructors and trainers, grantee partners, employers, and program participants—and quantitative management information systems data.
 The implementation analysis found that the extent to which Young Offender grantees implemented the YouthBuild model varied, though all attempted to adhere to the model. In general, grantees had mature organizational structures and were able to form partnerships with workforce development agencies and the juvenile justice system.
Young offenders tended to have better educational, employment, and social outcomes in grantee sites where teachers invested time in getting to know them on a personal level, the teacher-to-student ratio was low, academic work and vocational training were linked, and leadership opportunities were available.","","","","","","",""

Findings indicated that many SSI and DI recipients were working and engaging in work preparation activities, or saw themselves working in the future.

This study was focused on the Minimum Income and Bolsa Escola programs and dropped children from the sample if they had a handicapped member in their family, because the Census question included a handicapped aid transfer with the Bolsa Escola program, and the authors wanted to eliminate the effect of the handicapped transfer. Using several demographic characteristics (child, household, and community level) to assess the effectiveness of the cash transfer programs, the authors created a matched comparison group of families who reported that they had not received any income transfer to compare them to families in the treatment group who reported they had received an income transfer. The authors completed four analyses to include samples of: all families, poor children only, children with employed parents only, and poor children with employed parents only. The authors used a logit model separately for girls and boys to compare the schooling attendance and child labor outcomes of the treatment and control groups.","Employment/Child labor
The study did not find a significant relationship between the income transfer programs and child labor for boys or girls.
Education (School participation/enrollment)
The study found that participation in the income transfer programs was significantly associated with a 3-4 percentage point increase in school enrollment for boys and girls.","The authors created a matched group of non-participating eligible families to compare to income transfer participating families. However, the authors did not account for the outcomes at baseline, such as previous school attendance or child labor. Preexisting differences between the groups—and not the program/intervention— could explain the observed differences in outcomes.","",""

A California case of the Technology Management Program","The study’s objective was to examine the impact of participation in the University of California, Santa Barbara’s Technology Management Program (TMP) on students’ entrepreneurial attitudes.
The author compared the entrepreneurial attitudes of students at the beginning and the end of the spring 2008 academic term.
The study found that the overall entrepreneurial attitudes of students participating in the TMP became stronger over the course of the term.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the author did not account for pre-intervention trends in participants’ entrepreneurial attitudes. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the TMP courses the students took; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","In the late 1990s, the University of California, Santa Barbara College of Engineering established the Center for Engineering and Entrepreneurial Management, which created the TMP. The TMP offered a range of classes, culminating in a Certificate in Technology Entrepreneurship, for students interested in learning business skills, such as product development, technology management, and entrepreneurship. The program offered about 10 classes each term. Adjunct professors and lecturers with business experience taught most of the classes, which blended didactic instruction, guest speakers, entrepreneurship workshops, a business plan competition, and internship opportunities.","In spring 2008, the author asked students enrolled in any of the nine TMP courses available that term to participate in a voluntary survey at the beginning of the semester (March) and again at the end (June). The survey consisted of items designed to measure how strongly students identified with statements describing achievement-oriented business habits, innovation, personal control over business outcomes, and self-esteem. Each survey item asked the respondent to rate his or her agreement with a statement such as “I often approach business tasks in unique ways” on a scale from 1, strongly disagree, to 7, strongly agree.
Of the 430 students enrolled in a TMP course at that time, 75 completed both the pre- and post-course survey. The author compared the participants’ entrepreneurial attitudes before and after they participated in a TMP course, estimating the differences between pre- and post-test scores overall and in each of four attitude subscales. The analysis did not include controls for any demographic characteristics.","The study found a positive, statistically significant indicating that students more strongly identified with entrepreneurial perspectives at the end of the course than at the beginning.
In particular, students identified more strongly with survey items describing innovation in business and perceived personal control over business outcomes. The average response to innovation items increased from 5.09 to 5.22 out of 7.00 and the average response to personal control items increased from of 5.06 to 5.22 out of 7.00.","The author compared the outcomes of participants measured before and after they completed the spring 2008 TMP course. CLEAR’s guidelines require that the author observe outcomes for multiple periods before the intervention to rule out the possibility that students had increasing or decreasing trends in the outcomes examined before enrollment in the course. That is, if students who increasingly identified with entrepreneurial attitudes tended to enroll in the program, we would anticipate further increases over time, even if they did not participate in the program. Without knowing the trends before program enrollment, we cannot rule this out.
Further, CLEAR’s guidelines require that the study demonstrate that participants would not have selected into the intervention based on pre-intervention trends in the outcome and/or their own characteristics. Because the study results reflect only those students who chose to enroll in the program and to complete both the pre- and post-test surveys, they likely differ from eligible students who did not choose to enroll in the program. The characteristics that led these participants to enroll and complete the study might also affect the observed changes in attitudes.","",""

Since the OFSP program was expected to also help improve food security, the authors were also interested in assessing the combined effect of participating in both the PSNP and OFSP program. About 18 months after the PSNP began, the Food Security Program Survey was administered. The survey asked households about participation in public safety net programs such as the PSNP and OFSP, child and household characteristics, and children’s schooling and labor outcomes. The survey included questions about the households at the current time of the survey, and also included retrospective questions about the households prior to the initiation of the PSNP. Using propensity score matching, the authors created comparison groups matched on pre-program characteristics such as age, gender, asset levels, and schooling. The study included three treatment groups and comparison groups based on survey responses about household participation in the programs:
Treatment group 1 included households who had received any payment from the PSNP program within the past 12 months. A matched comparison group was developed for that treatment group that included any households that had not participated in PSNP or had participated but not received any payment through that program.
Treatment group 2 included households that received at least 90 birr per household member (or about $9 USD) through the PSNP. The matched comparison group developed for that group included households who did not participate in the PSNP program.
Treatment group 3 included households that received any payment from PSNP and received any type of benefit from OFSP. The matched comparison group included households that did not receive any OFSP benefits, and that was either not a participant of PSNP or was a PSNP participant who received no payments from the program.
All treatment and comparison groups excluded households who received Direct Support, which was a program that provided transfers to the elderly or people with disabilities. After the matched comparison groups were formed, the authors compared school attendance and child labor at 18 months between three treatment groups of those participating in the PSNP and those in a corresponding matched comparison groups who did not participate in the PSNP. Child labor was measured on the survey by asking households for the number of hours that children worked. School attendance was measured by asking households whether or not children attended school at the time the survey was completed. Analyses were separated to determine program effects by gender and child age (ages 6-10, 11-16, and 6-16).","Employment/Child labor

The study used school records from fall 2004 and fall 2005 cohorts to compare students who enrolled in learning community developmental math courses to students who enrolled in the standard math developmental courses and to a group of students in college-level courses who had similar placement exam scores.
The study found that, for the fall 2004 cohort, the retention rate for the learning community group was significantly lower than the rate for the nondevelopmental group between the fourth and fifth years after enrollment. In addition, for the fall 2005 cohort, the learning community group earned significantly fewer credit hours than the nondevelopmental group in the first, second, and fourth years after enrollment, and fewer credit hours than the nonlearning community developmental group in the fourth year.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the author did not control for relevant student characteristics in the analysis. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to learning communities. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The learning community intervention consisted of two linked courses: developmental algebra and a university seminar. For the 2004 cohort, the intervention included enhanced components: instructors provided additional tutoring and support as well as social activities. For the 2005 cohort, the intervention had no enhanced components.","The study analyzed outcomes for three groups of students at Middle Tennessee State University with American College Test (ACT) math subscores of 17, 18, or 19, in two cohorts. In both cohorts, all students were 23 years of age or younger, and the author used an exact matching procedure so that groups were equivalent in terms of gender and race/ethnicity. The treatment group consisted of learning community students enrolled in developmental courses. One comparison group consisted of students in developmental courses who did not take part in learning communities. The other consisted of students who were enrolled in college-level courses but had similar ACT math subscores. In the 2004 cohort, each group contained 42 students; in the 2005 cohort, each group contained 45 students. Using school record data, the study compared outcomes for the three groups jointly, separately by cohort and year. When joint tests were significant, authors performed additional tests to determine which individual contrasts were significant.","The study found that, for the fall 2004 cohort, the retention rate for the learning community group was significantly lower than the rate for the college-level comparison group between the fourth and fifth years after enrollment.
In addition, for the fall 2005 cohort, there were significant differences in cumulative credit hours earned. In the first, second, and fourth years after enrollment, the learning community group earned significantly fewer credit hours than the college-level comparison group. In the fourth year, the learning community group earned significantly fewer credit hours than the nonlearning community students enrolled in developmental courses.","The study accounted for differences in pre-intervention academic achievement, gender, ethnicity, and age in the analysis of progress toward degree completion outcomes. However, it did not account for potential differences in pre-intervention financial disadvantage. Estimated impacts could thus reflect pre-existing differences between the groups on this characteristic and not program impacts. For example, treatment students could have had lower socioeconomic status than comparison students, which could account for differences in progress toward degree completion outcomes at the end of the study. Therefore, the study is not eligible for a moderate causal evidence rating, the highest rating available for nonexperimental designs.","",""

The study was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which participants were assigned to one of three workshops: a learning goal-oriented (LGO) workshop, a performance goal-oriented (PGO) workshop, and a control workshop. The authors compared the job-search and reemployment outcomes of participants in the LGO or PGO workshops to the outcomes of those in the control workshop.
The study found that participants in the LGO workshop were 22 percentage points more likely to be reemployed eight weeks after the workshop than were participants in the control workshop, a statistically significant difference.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high for the comparison of PGO versus control participants’ reemployment statuses because these outcomes derived from a well-conducted RCT with low attrition. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to workshop type and not to other factors. However, the quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low for the comparison of LGO and control participants’ job-search behaviors and reemployment statuses and the comparison of PGO and control participants’ job-search behaviors because these outcomes derived from an RCT with high attrition that did not control adequately for potential differences in the analytic samples. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to workshop type; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Three types of workshops were included in the study. All lasted two to three hours and were held in groups of about five people.
The learning goal-oriented (LGO) workshop aimed for participants to use the workshop as an aid to improve their job seeking skills and master something new. Participants were asked to set learning goals and were given information and tools (an exercise book) to help them. Participants evaluated their competence according to whether they had mastered the task or developed their skills.
The performance goal-oriented (PGO) workshop aimed for participants to obtain the best possible results in their job search. Participants were asked to set performance goals and were given instruction and tools to help them, but were also encouraged to compete with one another and reward themselves when performing well. Participants evaluated their competence according to how they performed compared to others.
The control workshop had a similar structure to the LGO and PGO workshops but focused on exploring how participants' personalities related to their job search. At the workshop, participants completed a personality questionnaire. They then discussed the results of the questionnaire and how their personalities may be related to their job search.","The study took place at a reemployment counseling agency in the Netherlands. The study sample included 109 unemployed job seekers registered with the agency. The sample was 52.3 percent female with an average age of 46. Sample members had relatively little education: 56.0 percent had completed primary school or lower vocational training, 36.7 percent had graduated from high school, and 7.3 percent had completed college. Participants were randomly assigned to an LGO workshop, a PGO workshop, or a control workshop.
Participants completed a baseline questionnaire just before the workshop began and a similar questionnaire just after it ended. Participants also completed telephone interviews two and eight weeks after the workshop. The authors used regression analyses to compare the job-search and reemployment outcomes of participants in the LGO and PGO workshops with those in the control workshop, controlling for measures of job-search behavior and goal orientation collected in the pre-workshop survey.","The study found that participants in the LGO workshop were 22 percentage points more likely to be reemployed eight weeks after the workshop than were participants in the control workshop, a statistically significant difference.
Immediately following the workshops, participants in the LGO workshop demonstrated higher job-search intentions than did participants in the control workshop, a statistically significant difference. Participants in the LGO workshop also demonstrated significantly higher job-search intentions than those in the PGO workshop.
Two weeks following the workshops, participants in the LGO workshop exhibited greater job-search behaviors than did participants in the control workshop, a statistically significant difference.","The authors implemented an RCT, so outcomes that were measured through follow-up questionnaires administered immediately after the workshop, which all sample members completed, received a high causal evidence rating. However, not all sample members responded to the two- and eight-week follow-up interviews. In particular, attrition was high for the comparisons of LGO versus control and PGO versus control on job-search behavior outcomes and LGO versus control on reemployment outcomes. RCTs with high attrition can receive a moderate causal evidence rating if the authors either demonstrated that the analytic samples were equivalent before the intervention began or included adequate controls in the empirical model. In this case, the authors did not demonstrate equivalence on the analytic sample and did not control for age or a pre-intervention measure of employment, as CLEAR requires. As a result, the comparisons received a low causal evidence rating.","",""

Women identified as substance-dependent were randomly assigned to either the ICM or usual care treatment programs. The primary data sources were daily self-reports and follow-up interviews conducted 3, 9, 15, and 24 months after random assignment.
The study found that women in the ICM group were generally significantly more likely than women in the usual care group to be employed full-time, particularly at the 24-month follow-up period. In addition, the study found a significantly higher rate of improvement in employment outcomes for the ICM group compared with the usual care group.

The usual care group received the standard substance use disorders treatment program, which included a meeting with a clinical care coordinator for care referral. The ICM treatment program supplemented the standard substance use disorders treatment program with intensive case management and vouchers for attending treatment meetings. The ICM component included weekly meetings with case managers who tailored services to the women’s needs and treatment phase.","Women were eligible to participate in either the ICM or usual care program if they (1) were eligible for TANF, (2) were enrolled in New Jersey’s welfare-to-work program and had no medical deferrals, (3) spoke English, and (4) were diagnosed as substance-dependent as determined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition. The authors recruited 302 women meeting these criteria from welfare offices in Essex County, New Jersey. In total, 161 women were randomly assigned to the ICM treatment and 141 women were randomly assigned to the usual care treatment.
The authors measured employment using self-reports. The self-report consisted of daily data collection from baseline throughout the 24-month follow-up period. Follow-up interviews were conducted in months 3, 9, 15, and 24 after baseline. The authors used a regression model to compare the employment outcomes of the women in the ICM and usual care groups.","Overall, members of the ICM group were 1.68 times more likely to be employed full-time than were members of the usual care group, a statistically significant difference. This difference in employment was most pronounced at the 24-month follow-up period, when members of the ICM group were 3.24 times more likely to hold full-time positions than were members of the usual care group.
The rate of improvement in employment outcomes was 1.03 times higher for the ICM group than the usual care group with an incidence rate ratio equal to 1.03.
When examining comparisons that also accounted for the prior month’s employment, the ICM group worked 1.43 times more days in the following month compared with the usual care group.","The study was a randomized controlled trial with unknown attrition from the sample. Because attrition affected the treatment and control groups’ comparability on background characteristics that could have affected the outcomes of interest, CLEAR reviews the study as a quasi-experimental design. The authors noted that in the analytic sample the members of the control group were significantly younger than the members of the treatment group but did not account for this difference. As a result, the estimated program effects reflected differences related to age as well as any impact of the program.","",""

Communities largely selected households to participate in the PSNP based on whether they were poor and had received food aid in the past, although the specific selection process varied by locale.","The study used a matched comparison group design to understand the effects of the PSNP program on school attendance and child labor for children ages 6-16. Since the OFSP program was expected to also help improve food security, the authors were also interested in assessing the combined effect of participating in both the PSNP and OFSP program. About 18 months after the PSNP began, the Food Security Program Survey was administered. The survey asked households about participation in public safety net programs such as the PSNP and OFSP, child and household characteristics, and children’s schooling and labor outcomes. The survey included questions about the households at the current time of the survey, and also included retrospective questions about the households prior to the initiation of the PSNP. Using propensity score matching, the authors created comparison groups matched on pre-program characteristics such as age, gender, asset levels, and schooling. The study included three treatment groups and comparison groups based on survey responses about household participation in the programs:
Treatment group 1 included households who had received any payment from the PSNP program within the past 12 months. A matched comparison group was developed for that treatment group that included any households that had not participated in PSNP or had participated but not received any payment through that program.
Treatment group 2 included households that received at least 90 birr per household member (or about $9 USD) through the PSNP. The matched comparison group developed for that group included households who did not participate in the PSNP program.
Treatment group 3 included households that received any payment from PSNP and received any type of benefit from OFSP. The matched comparison group included households that did not receive any OFSP benefits, and that was either not a participant of PSNP or was a PSNP participant who received no payments from the program.
All treatment and comparison groups excluded households who received Direct Support, which was a program that provided transfers to the elderly or people with disabilities. The authors compared school attendance and child labor at 18 months between three treatment groups of those participating in the PSNP and those in a corresponding matched comparison groups who did not participate in the PSNP. Child labor was measured on the survey by asking households for the number of hours that children worked. School attendance was measured by asking households whether or not children attended school at the time the survey was completed. Analyses were separated to determine program effects by gender and child age (ages 6-10, 11-16, and 6-16).","Employment/Child labor
For boys and girls of all ages, the study did not find a significant relationship between receipt of benefits from PSNP and the number of hours worked.
 Education (School participation/enrollment)
For boys and girls of all ages, the study did not find a significant relationship between receipt of benefits from PSNP and school attendance rates.","While the study used a matched comparison group design, the authors did not account for other factors that could have affected the difference between the treatment and comparison groups, such as prior child labor participation. Also, the matched comparison group was formed using data collected 18 months after the intervention through retrospective survey items; households may not have reported accurately on their baseline characteristics given how much time had passed since the program began.","",""

The Medford site was one of four in Oregon that participated in the Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) project.
The authors randomly assigned 1,164 single parents to either a treatment group that received ERA services or a control group that could participate in other programs in the community. People in the study were current or recent Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program participants or people enrolled in other benefit programs that required clients to participate in employment or training. The authors analyzed data from Unemployment Insurance (UI), TANF, and Food Stamps administrative records and a survey administered 12 months after random assignment.
The study found that participants assigned to the Medford ERA program earned, on average, $40 more per week in the first year after random assignment than those in the control group.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is high because it was based on a well-conducted randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Medford ERA program and not to other factors.","","The ERA project was introduced in 1999 as a nationwide exploration of factors that help welfare recipients not only find employment but retain their positions and advance in their careers. Medford, Oregon, was one of 16 sites across the United States, including 4 in Oregon, to receive funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to implement a program intended to improve welfare recipients’ employment outcomes.
Medford’s Transition, Advancement, and Growth (TAAG) program provided retention- and career-focused case management services to current or recent welfare clients or people enrolled in Food Stamps or child care programs that required clients to participate in employment or training as a condition of benefits receipt. The Medford Department of Human Services, the Job Council, the Employment Department, and Rogue Community College collaborated to deliver TAAG. Program teams included job coaches, job counselors, job developers, case managers, learning plan specialists, and an employment specialist, all supervised by a project manager. Services included job search assistance, counseling, assistance with supportive services and transitional benefits, and education and training referrals.","From February 2002 to April 2004, evaluators randomly assigned 1,164 single parents to either a treatment group, which received ERA services, or a control group, which could participate in other programs typically offered in the community. Eligible individuals had formerly received TANF or were currently receiving the Oregon Food Stamp Employment and Training program and/or the Employment Related Day Care program. About 91 percent of participants were female, 90 percent were white non-Hispanic, and 78 percent had hourly wages of $7 or higher at baseline.
The authors estimated employment and earnings impacts by comparing UI wage records of treatment and control group members over the first 1.5 years after random assignment. The authors also calculated program impacts for benefit receipt measures, including whether participants received TANF or Food Stamps, through 1.5 years after random assignment using TANF and Food Stamps administrative records. Finally, the authors estimated impacts on self-reported employment and earnings using data from a survey administered 12 months following random assignment to a subsample of study participants.","The study found that those assigned to the Medford ERA program earned, on average, $40 more per week in the first year after random assignment than those in the control group. This difference was statistically significant at the 5 percent level.","Early in the study, the Medford program focused more on crisis management for clients and less on career advancement. This trend changed over time as staff spent more time on advancement services; however, many participants lost their jobs during the program, so job search assistance was a greater priority than anticipated. In addition, the program faced funding cuts that affected its staffing and operations.
The authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to employment, earnings, and benefits receipt. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not report that they performed statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","",""

The authors randomly assigned tax filers at 60 H&R Block locations in St. Louis, Missouri, to treatment conditions, defined by whether the filers were offered a 50 percent one-time match on IRA contributions, a 33 percent credit rebate on IRA contributions, or a 50 percent match on one-time and monthly IRA contributions. H&R Block provided tax filing information from the 2005 and 2006 tax years as well as background information on the filers.
The study found that offering a 50 percent match on one-time IRA contributions and offering a 33 percent credit rebate increased the likelihood of opening an IRA and the amount contributed, but the effect on the likelihood of opening an IRA was larger for the 50 percent match treatment group.
The quality of causal evidence is high for some outcomes because they were based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the treatment under study, and not to other factors. However, the quality of causal evidence for other outcomes is low because the analyses were based on a nonrandom subset of the randomized sample, and the author did not use sufficient controls when estimating impacts.","","","The author designed a randomized controlled trial in collaboration with 60 H&R Block locations in St. Louis, Missouri. Individuals who had filed their taxes at one of these locations in 2005 and returned in 2006 were eligible to participate. Members of the study sample were randomly assigned to one of several conditions, depending on the location at which they filed their taxes. The author constructed four study scenarios, in which all sample members, regardless of treatment condition, received a waiver for the IRA set-up fee:
In 19 offices (15,852 individuals), 10 percent of filers were offered a 50 percent match on one-time IRA contributions and 10 percent were offered a 33 percent credit rebate on an IRA contribution. Those who took up the credit rebate received 33 percent of their contribution amount as cash back. In these offices, 80 percent of filers were assigned to the control group.
In 20 offices (17,598 individuals), 10.4 percent of filers were offered a 50 percent match on one-time IRA contributions and received advanced notification of the match and fee waiver offer; 24.1 percent were offered a 50 percent match on one-time IRA contributions but did not receive advanced notification; 10.2 percent were assigned to the no-match group but did receive advanced notice of the IRA fee waiver; and 55.3 percent of filers were assigned to a control group that received no match and no advanced notification.
In 21 offices (14,878 individuals), 11 percent of filers were offered a 50 percent match on both one-time and monthly IRA contributions. The remaining 89 percent of filers were assigned to the control group.
Tax filers were randomly assigned to study groups using the last two digits of their Social Security numbers; both the tax filer and the tax preparer were blind to treatment assignment. The author estimated impacts on the IRA take-up rate and contribution amounts using H&R Block tax filing records.","The author estimated impacts for several contrasts:
Fifty percent match on one-time IRA contribution versus no match or credit control group: The average take up of an IRA was 5.72 percentage points higher and the average amount contributed was $50 greater in the 50 percent match group than the control group. Both impacts were statistically significant.
Thirty-three percent credit rebate on one-time IRA contribution versus no match or credit control group: The average take-up of an IRA was 2.4 percentage points higher and the average amount contributed was $19.85 greater in the 33 percent credit rebate group than the control group. Both impacts were statistically significant.
Fifty percent match versus 33 percent credit rebate on one-time IRA contributions: The offer of a 50 percent match increased the likelihood of making IRA contributions by a statistically significant 3.68 percentage points relative to the offer of a 33 percent credit rebate. However, there was no difference in the contribution amount.
Fifty percent match versus no match or credit control group on one-time and monthly IRA contributions: The match offer increased the likelihood of opening a one-time and systematic IRA by a statistically significant 1.44 percentage points relative to no match or credit offered.","The author randomly assigned all sample members to each treatment condition. However, in the treatment group that received advance notification, the author restricted the analytic sample to those who actually appeared at H&R Block to file their taxes in 2006. Because this is a nonrandom subset of those assigned to the advance notification group, the analyses involving this group must meet CLEAR evidence guidelines for nonexperimental studies, which require controls for age, gender, and income level. The author did not include controls for age or gender, so this analysis receives a low causal evidence rating.
The author noted that, because of tax preparer discretion, people in the study might not have received the treatment to which they were assigned. The author analyzed sample members based on the assigned treatment rather than the received treatment, so the effects presented in the study might underestimate the interventions’ impacts on those who were actually treated.","",""

The authors randomly assigned study participants to a treatment group, which could participate in Project GATE, or a control group, which could not participate. The authors collected information from all participants through follow-up surveys 6, 18, and 60 months after random assignment.
The study found that Project GATE increased the likelihood of business ownership in the second and third quarters after random assignment. The study found few statistically significant impacts on employment or earnings over the 60-month follow-up period, though generally the Project GATE participants were slightly less likely than the control group members to be employed in later follow-up periods.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high for outcomes measured in the first two quarters after assignment because these outcomes were based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. However, outcomes measured at other follow-up points present low causal evidence because of high attrition and insufficient adjustment for differences in previous employment and earnings history.","","Project GATE was a demonstration project that operated in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Minneapolis–St. Paul and northeastern Minnesota; and three cities in Maine from fall 2003 to summer 2005. It was open to anyone older than 18 who resided in one of the participating sites and had a business idea. Applicants had to provide information on their personal characteristics and business idea. Very few people were denied participation based on their business idea or their qualifications for starting a business.
As part of the demonstration, the authors randomly assigned 2,095 Project GATE applicants to a treatment group that could participate in the project and 2,103 applicants to the control group that could not participate in Project GATE (but could access other employment services available in the community). Members of the treatment group underwent an assessment interview with a Project GATE assessment counselor and together they selected the most appropriate services to meet the participant’s self-employment needs. The counselor referred the participant to an appropriate service provider—a One-Stop Career Center, nonprofit community-based organization, or small business development center—that offered entrepreneurship training, one-on-one business counseling, and help applying for business loans.
The authors then contacted all study participants for follow-up surveys about their self-employment; wage and salary employment; and earnings 6, 18, and 60 months after random assignment. The authors compared the outcomes of treatment and control group members in each quarter following random assignment.","","Employment. The study found that Project GATE increased the likelihood of business ownership during the second and third quarters after random assignment, but that did not persist to later quarters.
Earnings. In the first two quarters after random assignment, Project GATE participants earned significantly less than control group participants did. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in earnings in later quarters.","The study included three follow-up surveys. The six-month survey sample had low attrition and the outcomes received a high causal evidence rating. However, subsequent follow-up survey samples had high attrition and were reviewed as nonexperimental designs. For employment and earnings outcomes measured by the 18- and 60-month surveys, the authors did not account for differences in previous employment and earnings between the Project GATE members and the control group members. These existing differences between the groups—and not Project GATE—could explain the observed differences in outcomes. As a result, the employment and earnings outcomes from the 18- and 60-month surveys received low causal evidence ratings.","",""

Participants were randomly assigned to a treatment group, which was eligible for the more generous work incentive, or a control group that was not. The authors examined impacts on employment and earnings using state unemployment insurance (UI) wage records.
The study found that the BOPD in Vermont had statistically significant, positive impacts on treatment group members’ employment and earnings in the three quarters after random assignment. However, the effects generally did not persist over the full two-year follow-up period.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the BOPD, and not to other factors.","","Administered by SSA, the BOPD was a pilot test of the later Benefit Offset National Demonstration. The primary intervention was a benefit offset that replaced the so-called cash cliff SSDI recipients who work eventually experience. The cash cliff refers to the fact that SSDI recipients who have completed a nine-month TWP followed by a three-month grace period have all their SSDI benefits suspended or terminated if they earn more than a threshold amount known as substantial gainful activity (SGA). The benefit offset replaces the complete loss of all benefits for working SSDI recipients, instead gradually withdrawing the SSDI benefit by $1 for every $2 earned above the SGA amount. SSA discontinued benefit offset eligibility for BOPD treatment subjects who had not completed a TWP by December 31, 2008, which was two years earlier than BOPD treatment subjects had initially been told their benefit offset eligibility would expire.
BOPD was implemented in four states: Connecticut, Utah, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Apart from recruiting SSDI recipients who received benefits solely based on their own earnings records, had completed a trial work period within the past 72 months, and were not concurrently receiving Supplemental Security Income benefits, the states were free to select their own program eligibility criteria. For the first 10 months of the enrollment period, Vermont restricted program eligibility to current or recent clients of the Vermont Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (DVR), the agency that administered the BOPD in Vermont. Although this restriction was lifted in the last five months of the enrollment period, most Vermont participants (96 percent) had prior involvement with the DVR. Other sources of recruitment included the Vermont Division for the Blind and Visually Impaired, the adult community mental health system, and people served through the developmental disabilities system. Of the 3,000 Vermont residents contacted to participate in the BOPD, 904 responded to the initial solicitation. Ultimately, 577 were found eligible, consented to participate, and were enrolled in the demonstration.","The BOPD in Utah was evaluated using a randomized controlled trial. Utah SSDI recipients deemed eligible for the pilot were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which received the benefit offset, or the control group, which received services as usual. Both groups remained eligible to receive benefits counseling and other standard services.
The authors analyzed data from state UI wage records. The key outcome variables were quarterly employment rates, earnings, and an indicator of earnings in excess of the SGA level. The authors estimated impacts on employment and earnings outcomes for the two research groups for eight quarters (two years) after enrollment.","The study found statistically significant impacts on employment rates in two of the eight quarters following random assignment (follow-up quarters 1 and 3). 
The study found statistically significant impacts on average quarterly earnings in two of the eight quarters following random assignment (follow-up quarters 1 and 2).
Treatment group members were more likely than control group members to have earnings in excess of the SGA amount in four of the eight quarters following random assignment (follow-up quarters 1, 2, 4, and 8).","The volunteers who participated in the BOPD were not likely to be representative of the larger SSDI recipient population because they were typically recruited from organizations that helped clients obtain employment, and were therefore likely to be representative of the 20 percent of SSDI recipients who reported an expectation of returning to work. In addition, the decision by SSA to restrict eligibility to SSDI recipients who completed their trial work period within the past 72 months disqualified potential participants with longer work histories; these people might have benefited the most from the program.","",""

Quick Enrollment offered employees the choice of joining a 401(k) plan at a fixed contribution rate, investing in prespecified funds.
Hewitt Associates, a consultancy and benefits management company, provided data on 401(k) plan participation, compensation, and other demographic characteristics for employees at two anonymous firms. For company A, year-end cross-sectional data from 2002 and 2003 were available for all employees in addition to a September 1, 2004, snapshot. For company B, only year-end data for 2002 and 2003 were available.
Plan enrollment rates for new employees rose after each Quick Enrollment implementation, with an enrollment increase of 14 percentage points at company A and 2 percentage points at company B.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is low. This means that we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to Quick Enrollment; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","","","New hires at company A offered the Quick Enrollment option were 14 percentage points more likely to enroll in the company’s 401(k) plan within one month of hire than those offered the traditional opt-in enrollment method, a statistically significant difference.
Among previously nonparticipating employees at company A, 20 percent joined the 401(k) plan after the Quick Enrollment period.
Overall 401(k) enrollments at company B increased 2 percentage points from February 1 to June 1, 2003, from a pre-intervention rate of 74 percent.","Although all three studies implemented similar interventions, we analyzed them as distinct interrupted time series designs because each study employed a different initial 401(k) contribution rate and asset allocation. Each intervention reviewed here was implemented only once. This makes it difficult to conclude that the observed changes in enrollment rates were driven by the interventions themselves, instead of other concurrent changes.
The timing of the nonparticipant study at company A also introduced concern that many employees chose to enroll in the 401(k) plan not because of Quick Enrollment but because the online benefits registration meeting brought retirement savings to their attention. Similar issues pertain to the analysis of company B, in which those who received the intervention were compared with nonparticipating employees who were eligible to receive a Quick Enrollment mailing but did not receive the information. Because this control group is unlikely to be a representative sample of all company B nonparticipants, the comparison combines the effect of Quick Enrollment with that of possible intrinsic differences between those who received mailings and those who did not.","Company A: A large health services company that had about 40,000 employees

The authors conducted a series of eight focus groups with science and engineering faculty at a university in the United States to discuss what the organization currently did well and what it could do well in the future, and drew out common themes across the discussions.
The authors recommended the following best practices for institutions to better recruit female faculty in STEM: (1) create clear and transparent job postings; (2) promote the benefits that the department, university, and community have to offer potential candidates; and (3) actively recruit candidates (for example, by developing relationships with universities and pursuing candidates before they apply for a position).
The authors also suggested best practices for developing female faculty, including training staff at all levels on the cognitive biases against women, creating within-organization mentoring and networking opportunities for female faculty in STEM, developing family-friendly policies such as leave and flexible schedules, allotting time and funding for professional development, and actively developing women for leadership positions.","","","","","","",""

Admission to Camp Reach was determined through a lottery of girls who applied to the program and met eligibility requirements. Six to seven years later, the authors administered a survey to 109 girls who had been admitted to the program and 107 girls who had not. Many girls in the control group attended other, similar programs.
The study found that members of the control group who had attended other summer science or engineering programs at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) were significantly more likely to have taken high school calculus than were members of the Camp Reach Partial group. There were no statistically significant differences on taking physics, computer science, other science and engineering courses, or planning to major in engineering in high school.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors adjusted the research sample after random assignment and did not include adequate controls to ensure that the resulting groups were similar on all relevant attributes. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects were attributable to Camp Reach; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Camp Reach was a two-week summer engineering program for rising 7th-grade girls run through WPI. The program aimed to encourage girls’ interest in and pursuit of engineering and other STEM fields through design workshops and mentoring. It emphasized collaborative problem-solving through a collaborative public service engineering project, which showed how engineering can be a helping profession. The camp promoted continued engagement through alumnae newsletters and reunions.","Camp Reach made 30 places available to interested applicants each year; those applicants meeting minimum eligibility criteria were entered in a lottery through which camp organizers selected the summer’s participants, who formed the treatment group. The group of selected participants was then adjusted to reflect the demographic profile of Worcester, Massachusetts, where the program was held. Those who were not invited to participate formed the control group.
The authors contacted 252 girls who had applied to Camp Reach from 1997 to 2001 in 2004 through 2007, six to seven years after they had applied, to complete a survey. Of these, 176 responded. The authors compared the responses of the treatment and control group members on survey questions about their knowledge of engineering, the science and engineering courses they took in high school, and plans to major in science or engineering in college.
To estimate impacts, the authors organized the treatment and control groups into subgroups. First, they distinguished between girls in the treatment group who had attended the summer session of Camp Reach (Camp Reach Partial) and those who had participated in alumnae reunions and the initial summer session (Camp Reach Full). Because further program participation was nonexperimental, this review focuses on treatment survey respondents who attended only the Camp Reach summer session. In addition, the authors organized the control group into those who had or had not attended other science and engineering programs, because many survey respondents who were not selected for Camp Reach ultimately participated in similar programs offered by WPI.","The study found that members of the control group who had attended other summer science or engineering programs at WPI were significantly more likely to have taken high school calculus than were members of the Camp Reach Partial group. There were no statistically significant differences on taking physics, computer science, other science and engineering courses, or planning to major in engineering in high school.
There were no statistically significant differences between members of the Camp Reach Partial group and members of the control group who did not attend other science or engineering camps at WPI.","The authors acknowledged that the randomly selected attendee groups were modified after random selection to replicate Worcester’s demographic profile. This adjustment means that the assignment was no longer random, and therefore this study cannot receive a high causal evidence rating. The adjustment of the research sample after random assignment could have induced differences between the treatment and control groups on characteristics that also influenced the outcomes of interest. Because the techniques the authors used to estimate the program’s effect did not adequately control for these potential differences, they cannot distinguish the effects of Camp Reach from the effects of differences in relevant demographic characteristics.","",""

[TAA]","The study’s objective was to examine the impact of the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) Program on the employment, earnings, and benefit receipt of dislocated workers in Indiana.
The author used a nonexperimental method to compare the short-term (three quarters after program exit) and long-term (seven quarters after program exit) employment and earnings between those who took part in the TAA Program relative to those who participated in the WorkOne program.
The study found that, compared with those who participated in the WorkOne program, TAA Program participants had higher employment and lower benefit receipt.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the author did not ensure that the groups compared were similar before program participation. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the TAA Program; other factors are likely to have contributed.
This study also examined the effectiveness of other workforce development programs. Please click here to find CLEAR profiles of those studies.","","The TAA Program was designed to facilitate training and provide support to workers who have lost their jobs as a result of foreign competition. The TAA Program served people ages 18 and older through core services; these included job training, job search, relocation support, and assistance with healthcare premium costs. Receipt of income assistance and other benefits varied by state and nature of foreign competition.","The author used a nonexperimental statistical approach called propensity score matching to create a comparison group of people who participated in WorkOne and were similar to TAA Program participants in terms of demographic characteristics, including gender, age, educational attainment, race, and employment and earnings history. The author then compared the two groups on employment, quarterly earnings, and benefit receipt. The author collected Indiana Workforce Intelligence System records and Unemployment Insurance records for those who had exited the TAA or WorkOne program in fiscal year 2006. The study included a sample of 2,376 workers who received services through the TAA Program and 272,780 workers who received services through the WorkOne program in Indiana.","Employment. The study found that, compared with that of those who participated in WorkOne, the employment rate for the TAA group significantly increased by 5.1 percentage points in the seventh quarter after program exit.
Benefit receipt. The study found that average quarterly Unemployment Insurance receipt significantly decreased by $95 in the third quarter after program exit for those who took part in the TAA program compared with those in the WorkOne group.","Although the author accounted for many underlying characteristics of the groups being compared, which could also influence their outcomes, the author’s decision to define the groups based on their date of program exit rather than program entry is problematic. For example, suppose that the TAA and WorkOne participants were on identical wage trajectories before receiving services from their respective programs and that the average length of participation in TAA services was six months, whereas that for WorkOne was one month. At the conclusion of participation, they exited the program.
If we compared the groups’ earnings 6 months after their recorded exit dates, we would observe TAA participants’ earnings about 12 months after they started receiving services and WorkOne participants’ earnings about 7 months after they started receiving services. If both programs were completely ineffective and everyone stayed on their original upward-sloping wage trajectory, it would appear as though the TAA participants earned more 6 months after their exit dates. However, this would not be attributable to receiving TAA services; it would be caused by the different elapsed time across the groups (12 months for TAA participants versus 7 months for WorkOne participants). Therefore, studies defining the groups based on exit date, rather than entry date, cannot receive a moderate causal evidence rating.","",""

The authors used an experimental design to compare the outcomes of children ages 7 to 14 residing in municipalities who received income transfers with those residing in municipalities who did not receive income transfers. Based on data from Brazil’s national household survey, the authors used statistical models to assess the impact of the program in each group.
The PETI program was significantly associated with an increase in time in school and less time in work for participating children.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because it is a randomized controlled trial with unknown attrition and the authors did not ensure that the groups being compared were similar before the intervention. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the PETI program; other factors are likely to have contributed.","Absence of conflict of interest.","The Programa de Erradicacao do Trabalho Infantil (PETI) or Program to Eradicate Child Labor was launched in poor rural states in Brazil in 1996. The program offers monthly income transfers to households with a per capita income of below one-half of the minimum wage on the condition that the child(ren) in the household attends school at 80 percent of the time and attends an afterschool program, which doubles the school day. The program requires parents to sign a contract that their children will not work.","The authors used data from six municipalities in each of three states in Brazil: Bahia, Sergipe, and Pernambuco, where three municipalities were in the treatment and three in control groups. Data were collected on 3,564 households with 6,772 children ages 7 to 14. The authors limited the sample to the poorest household, resulting in 2,864 households and 5,611 children. Each of the three states implemented the program in different time periods, Pernambuco for three years, Sergipe for two years, and Bahia for one year. The model specifications include the impact of PETI on the time in school and time in the labor market for children residing in participating municipalities versus those in control municipalities.","Employment/Child labor
The PETI program was significantly associated with a decrease in time in the labor force for participating children from 5 to 6 percentage points in Pernambuco, 18 percentage points in Bahia, and 4.5 percentage points in Sergipe.
Education (School participation/enrollment) 
The PETI program was significantly associated with an increase in school attendance for participating children from 40 to 50 percent in Bahia and Pernambuco and 5 to 23 percent in Sergipe.","The authors used experimental data from a randomized sample of municipalities in Brazil. However, they did not include information on attrition or account for the outcomes at baseline, such as previous school attendance or child labor.

The program provided skills training, case management, and follow-up services to at risk youth and those with previous criminal justice experience between the ages of 14 and 21.
The study examined RNF programs in 19 sites, focusing on program organization, sub-grantee characteristics, and participant characteristics and outcomes. The study utilized management information system (MIS) data, staff interviews, site visits, participant focus groups, and interviews with community partners.
The program was successful in reaching and retaining minority youth and those with previous criminal justice experience, largely because program subgrantees were located in and matched the neighborhoods they served, and had staff members who seemed similar to, and accessible to, their target population.
The Latino Coalition, the intermediary organization, played a critical role in the program’s success by establishing a robust organizational and oversight structure and providing capacity-building assistance to the relatively new and small faith-based and community organizations delivering program services.","","The RNF program was a three-year program developed by the Latino Coalition and funded through a $10 million grant from the U.S. Department of Labor in 2004. The program served at-risk youth between the ages of 14 and 21, and sought to help increase their employment rates, job preparedness, and educational achievement, as well as to avoid recidivism. 80 percent of youth served were required to be Latino, and 60 percent were required to have previous experience with the criminal justice system.
The program was a multi-state intervention involving 28 subgrantees in six cities (Phoenix, AZ; Los Angeles and San Diego, CA; Denver, CO; and Dallas and Houston, TX). The subgrantees were typically relatively new, small faith-based and community organizations that were largely located in the areas they served. All subgrantees offered some participants soft skills training, case management, and follow-up services. The subgrantees had discretion over which of 10 other service options to provide: GED preparation, basic and remedial education, skills training, community service, internships, subsidized or unsubsidized work experience, job preparation, occupational training, mentoring, and substance-abuse services.","The study examined RNF program organization; subgrantee organization, implementation, outreach, services, and experiences; and participant characteristics and outcomes. It included 19 active sites that received Latino Coalition funding in the third year of the program in five cities: Phoenix, AZ; Los Angeles and San Diego, CA; Denver, CO; and Houston, TX. Data sources included (1) MIS data on participant characteristics, service receipt, and outcomes; (2) interviews with central office staff; (3) site visits to all sites; (4) 19 participant focus groups in the 11 sites that were still receiving some Latino Coalition funding in early 2008; and (5) focus groups with community partners identified by community subgrantees.","The program was implemented by subgrantees that were small, faith-based community organizations with very limited experience and capacity, especially for data collection and record keeping. The Latino Coalition—the intermediary grantee organization—provided critical input for program success to these subgrantees. It established a robust organizational and oversight structure and assisted subgrantees in capacity building by drawing on outside consultants and hiring city directors (one per site). City directors played a particularly important role, providing two-way channels of communication, acting as coaches and trainers, conducting quality control, and inculcating sustainability. Subgrantees perceived the city directors as knowledgeable, skillful, and very responsive to their requests for assistance. Subgrantees partnered primarily with probation departments and officers, schools, churches, and community service agencies—rather than with the workforce system—in recruiting participants and delivering services.
The program was successful in reaching and retaining minority youth and those with previous criminal justice experience, because program subgrantees were mostly located in, and matched, the neighborhoods they served, and had staff members with backgrounds similar to those of program participants. Staff befriended participants and made themselves accessible and available. In addition, programs that offered appealing skills training (such as computer graphic design, video/sound recording and editing) and integrative services—activities beyond the RNF program—had greater retention.
Overall, subgrantees appeared to have been effective at engaging participants, but had mixed success in implementing all the prescribed steps for following up with them. Staff were diligent about performing initial assessments and developing initial service plans, but found it difficult and sometimes unwise to follow the service plan developed at the outset. They also found it difficult to maintain monthly contact with participants, given the highly transient and mobile nature of the target population.
The descriptive analysis of participant outcomes revealed several positive trends. 28 percent of all program participants and 40 percent of out-of-school participants had positive employment, job training, or education outcomes. Participating youths had low recidivism rates—just 9 percent. The degree to which participants engaged with the program also appeared to play an important role, as increased time spent in the RNF program was correlated with better outcomes. Participants of integrative programs had better outcomes than those of non-integrative programs. There did not appear to be a difference between the outcomes of participants of faith-based programs and those of community-based programs.","The study did not include a thorough description of data collection, data analysis, data quality control, and triangulation methods, or the degree to which its key findings were prevalent across study sites or study participants. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the extent to which the findings based on site visits and interviews reflect the average program experience. In addition, study results should not be interpreted as generalizable to all participating sites; they might represent the views and experiences of more successful sites, since only those sites receiving a third year of grant funding were included in the study. In addition, program completers were disproportionately represented in the focus groups, relative to program noncompleters.","",""

The study found that most participants spent a considerable amount of time with their mentors each week, with some also taking advantage of career advancement and educational preparation services.

This CLEAR profile focuses on the process study component of the evaluation. Other components of the evaluation included an overview of beneficiaries’ characteristics and an impact analysis. This study sought to gain insight into successes, challenges, and lessons related to program outreach and recruitment—drawing relevant information on all five sites from interviews, program documents, state-level evaluation reports, and enrollment data.
Key findings indicated that most state DMIE programs faced challenges in recruitment—given delays in designing program processes and obtaining approvals, low interest from eligible beneficiaries, and poor access to data needed for outreach and screening—but eventually met enrollment targets. The authors also found that state DMIE programs that were designed around existing health programs were most successful in implementing streamlined recruitment, strategically supplementing available health benefits, and conducting swift program roll-out through existing provider networks.","","The DMIE, which was authorized under the 1999 Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act and funded by CMS, aimed to delay or prevent reliance on Social Security disability benefits through medical assistance and other supports. Hawaii, Kansas, Minnesota, Texas, and the District of Columbia received federal funding to design and test innovative programs to obtain this objective. Each provided health care services beyond existing health insurance coverage, as well as discounted deductibles, premiums, and copayments. DMIE participants also received employment services such as vocational rehabilitation and service coordination and a personal case manager. DMIE enrollment occurred from 2002 through 2008 and varied by state. All DMIE services expired on September 30, 2009.
The age range for eligible participants varied slightly across states but was roughly 18 to 62. Eligible participants also had to work at least 40 hours per month, not have pending disability applications, and neither be receiving Social Security disability benefits nor have pending applications for benefits. Minnesota and Texas recruited low-income residents with severe mental illness from certain parts of the states. In Texas, participants also had to be uninsured and have a physical disability. Kansas recruited statewide participants with both physical and mental disabilities from its high-risk insurance pool and Hawaii recruited people with diabetes who lived in the city and county of Honolulu. The District of Columbia recruited workers with HIV/AIDS with incomes at or below 300 percent of the federal poverty level. Given the different recruitment strategies and target populations, participants varied across states in terms of age, marital status, ethnicity, college degree attainment rates, physical and mental capabilities, and employment characteristics.","The first round of the process study covered by this report aimed to gain a comprehensive understanding of early implementation practices (specifically with regard to outreach and recruitment). To achieve this goal, the authors drew on one or more of the following qualitative data sources: (1) site visit interviews conducted in the first or second year of implementation with state-level program staff and evaluators and other stakeholders; (2) monthly calls among CMS, the authors, and state-level staff to review implementation progress; (3) state-level operational and evaluation protocols; (4) quarterly reports from states on design updates, recruitment progress, service provision and uptake, and evaluation efforts; and (5) publications by state-level evaluators. The process study also used quantitative data on program enrollment, participation, and withdrawal submitted by the states to the national evaluator.","The process study found that program sites were generally successful in adapting DMIE for—and attracting the interest of—their target populations. After addressing the initially poor response to outreach efforts, all sites except Hawaii exceeded or came very close to meeting their enrollment targets. The study provided useful information on challenges faced in recruitment, solutions developed by program staff, and best practices for the future. 
Recruitment challenges. At the design stage, devising strategies to identify eligible and interested beneficiaries took longer than expected, as did the process of acquiring institutional review board approvals for state-level evaluations. In the outreach phase, program staff grappled with gaps in contact information for potential beneficiaries and found that a distrust of service packages that seemed too good to be true and an unwillingness to share health and employment information detracted many from volunteering for the program. For screening, administrators had difficulty obtaining employment verifications and other necessary data. Overall, state DMIE programs took more than 12 months to conduct recruitment and increase enrollment into the program. 
Solutions to recruitment challenges. States were quick to respond to recruitment challenges and willing to adapt selection and outreach strategies on short notice. Solutions included (1) increasing the program’s geographic coverage, (2) widening the age brackets for program eligibility, (3) supplementing mail outreach with in-person recruitment at clinics, and (4) conducting supplementary rounds of outreach and intensive follow-up.
Enrollment results. Eventually, all sites but one surpassed or came very close to achieving their enrollment targets, except Hawaii. In Hawaii, the majority of those eligible for DMIE had state-mandated, employer-sponsored health coverage that met most of their diabetes-related health needs, and therefore they had limited incentive to participate in a program that offered a relatively narrow set of supplementary services and required a significant time commitment. In Minnesota, CMS decreased the enrollment target to allow for the above solutions to recruitment challenges to succeed.
Lessons related to program design. Overall, programs that targeted people enrolled in existing state health coverage programs were well-positioned for recruitment because they had a preselected group of candidates to market the program to and easy access to contact information required for outreach and other data needed for eligibility screenings. Building on ongoing programs also enabled state DMIE programs to use existing provider networks to facilitate rapid implementation and to ensure that program offerings supplemented benefits that were already available to the target populations.
Lessons related to program management. DMIE programs often involved a variety of stakeholders, including state Medicaid agencies, local health insurance and health care providers, organizations offering specialized services, and independent evaluators. The study found that centralizing leadership in one organization ensured swift identification and resolution of problems and effective coordination of implementation processes.","This was a well-structured and clearly written report, summarizing information on program implementation in the same sequence for each state (starting with the intervention design and then describing key actors, recruitment practices, and early lessons learned). The authors used a variety of qualitative data sources to answer the research questions and drew in quantitative data when relevant. Although the report carefully described quality assurance protocols applied to the quantitative data sets, it did not provide adequate detail on the qualitative data, on which core program implementation findings were based. Without detailed information on who was interviewed, sample sizes and selection strategies, and steps taken to ensure data quality, it was difficult to fully assess the reliability of the data. However, the authors presented findings impartially, highlighting both the positives and negatives of program design, as well as successes and challenges in implementation.","",""

Specifically, RFS helped clients more effectively access work supports (such as child care and transportation) and negotiate work-related issues through the development of soft skills (such as interpersonal and communication skills). Services were tailored to clients’ needs and levels of motivation. Case managers worked with small caseloads and used work-, education-, and training-based strategies to provide coaching and assistance to clients.
To be eligible for the program, which operated through the Los Angeles Department of Public Social Services (DPSS) from March 2002 to June 2005, people had to (1) be a single-parent recipient of TANF benefits for no more than one year, (2) reside in one of the three target regions, and (3) have worked 32 or more hours per week in a full-time job for the past 30 days. Beginning in the late 1990s, DPSS-provided postemployment services were offered through the Los Angeles County Greater Avenues for Independence program, which was organized into seven regions. The RFS program was piloted in three of these regions.","From the end of July 2002 to June 2004, evaluators identified and randomly assigned 5,412 people who met the study eligibility criteria, half to the RFS group and half to the post-employment services group.
Evaluators followed study participants for two years after random assignment, collecting quarterly employment, income, and public benefit (TANF and Food Stamps) data from state administrative records. A subset of sample members also responded to a 12-month follow-up survey that focused on employment, income, and other outcomes. Authors compared the outcomes of treatment and control group members, controlling for prerandom assignment characteristics.","The study found that treatment group (RFS) participants were 3.0 percent more likely to receive TANF and 2.7 percent more likely to receive Food Stamps in the last quarter of the two-year follow-up period than the post-employment services group, although the total amount of benefits they received was statistically similar to the amount that control group participants received.","The increase in public assistance receipt for RFS participants seems contrary to the RFS program’s goal to reduce dependence on TANF and Food Stamps by improving employment outcomes. Significantly more RFS group members than control group members reported receiving help with acquiring public assistance.
The authors attributed the lack of positive program outcomes in employment and earnings to similar experiences between treatment and control group members. Nearly the same number of people in each group sought and received post-employment services and they had statistically similar frequencies of contact with their case managers.","",""

Students in the Opening Doors and Enhanced Opening Doors programs took a college success course that covered topics such as personal goals, study skills, and college rules, and had to visit the college’s student success centers for tutoring sessions.
The study was a randomized controlled trial. Eligible students were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group. In the original Opening Doors program, students assigned to the treatment group were offered the opportunity to participate in the program. In the Enhanced Opening Doors program, students in the treatment group were required to participate in the program. The control groups for both the original and Enhanced Opening Doors programs were not required to participate in the program. The primary data sources were a baseline survey on the background characteristics of students, students’ transcripts, and degree attainment information from the National Student Clearinghouse.
The study found no significant impacts on students’ course registration, the number of semesters enrolled, or regular credits accumulated for the original Opening Doors program. For the Enhanced Opening Doors program, the study found that the treatment group earned significantly more nondegree credits and developmental credits during each of the two program semesters and cumulatively across both program semesters, compared with the control group. Additionally, at the end of both program semesters, a higher proportion of students in the Enhanced Opening Doors program were in good academic standing (that is, earned a grade point average of 2.0 or higher and were not on probation due to attempting fewer than 12 credits or completing fewer than half of attempted credits) compared with students in the control group.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Enhanced Opening Doors program, and not to other factors.","","In fall 2006 and spring 2007, Chaffey Community College implemented a mandatory two-semester program called Enhanced Opening Doors. The Enhanced Opening Doors program was built upon an earlier Opening Doors program, which was a one-semester intervention in fall 2005 that included three related components: (1) a voluntary three-credit college success course, taught by a college guidance counselor, which covered personal goals, college rules and regulations, and study skills; (2) visits to the student success center, where students would complete exercises addressing skills and personal learning styles, time management, and test preparation; and (3) the provision of counseling services both during and outside the college success course. The Enhanced Opening Doors program shared the same three core features as the original Opening Doors progam, but included three substantial changes. First, Enhanced Opening Doors was expanded to a two-semester intervention that mandated enrollment in the three-credit college success course in the first semester and offered a voluntary success course in the second semester. Second, the Enhanced program required that students complete at least five visits to the student success centers in the first program semester. Third, the counselors who taught the college success course were more experienced than those in the original program, and greater emphasis was placed on the importance of meeting with students outside of class.
To participate in the Enhanced Opening Doors program, students had to be on academic or progress probation, have earned fewer than 35 credits toward a degree or credential, hold a high school degree or general educational development certificate, and be part-time or full-time students ages 18 to 34.","This study was a randomized controlled trial. Randomization occurred at the student level, separately for each cohort. Eligible students who consented to participate in the study were randomized either to the treatment group, which, for the original Opening Doors, was offered the opportunity to enroll in the program, and for the Enhanced Opening Doors, was required to participate in the program. Students assigned to the control group could voluntarily enroll in the student success course and access existing college services. There were 898 students in the original Opening Doors study, with 448 in the treatment group and 450 in the control group. There were 444 students in the Enhanced Opening Doors study, with 224 in the treatment group and 220 in the control group.
The authors used data from the baseline data form, student transcripts from Chaffey Community College, attendance records from Chaffey College Success Centers, and information from the National Student Clearinghouse. Impacts were reported as the difference of means between the treatment and control groups, adjusted for the timing of random assignment. For the Opening Doors program, the study reported outcomes for four semesters: the program semester and three subsequent follow-up semesters. For the Enhanced Opening Doors program, the study reported outcomes for the two program semesters.","The study found no impacts of the original Opening Doors program in any of the post-program semesters, or cumulatively over the four semesters following random assignment, on the number of semesters enrolled in college, course registration, regular credits earned, or the proportion of students who were ever in good academic standing at Chaffey.
For the Enhanced Opening Doors program, the study found no cumulative impacts over the two program semesters on the number of semesters enrolled in college, course registration, or regular credits earned. However, the study found that the treatment group earned 2.6 more nondegree and 0.5 more developmental credits during the two program semesters than the control group. This difference was statistically significant. In addition, the study found that a significantly higher proportion of the treatment group (30.4 percent) was ever in good academic standing cumulatively across the two program semesters compared with the control group (15.9 percent). Similarly, a significantly lower proportion of treatment group students (58.0 percent) was never in good academic standing compared with the control group (71.8 percent) through both program semesters.","A key difference between the original Opening Doors and Enhanced Opening Doors programs was the requirement in the Enhanced program that students in the treatment group take the first-semester college success course. The authors noted, however, that Chaffey College decided not to enforce this component of the Enhanced program. Nevertheless, the authors suggested that by sending the message that the course was required, the college might have been able to engage students who would otherwise not have taken part on their own.
The authors noted that differences in implementation might also have contributed to the observed differences in outcomes between the treatment and control groups in the Enhanced Opening Doors program compared with the original program. The authors indicated that the College Success course in the Enhanced Opening Doors program was taught by more experienced instructors, and more than half of these instructors had taught the course in the original Opening Doors program. The authors also suggested that the visits to the Success Centers that were part of both the original and Enhanced Opening Doors programs were better integrated with themes from the College Success course in the Enhanced program.
The study authors performed multiple statistical tests on related outcomes in the progress toward degree completion domain, which makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in this domain is likely to be overstated.","",""

WorkSource services included staff-assisted job matching, provision of labor market information, job search and placement assistance, and initial assessments.
Using a nonexperimental design, the authors compared the employment and earnings of Unemployment Insurance (UI) claimants who received at least one WorkSource service with those of UI claimants who did not receive any WorkSource services using state UI administrative records for more than 64,000 Washington State UI claimants with no UI-reported wage earnings in the third quarter of 2007.
The study found that WorkSource services were associated with a higher probability of employment and higher earnings growth for men and women who were intermittently (rather than continuously) employed in the baseline period.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to WorkSource services. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Washington’s WorkSource is a collaboration of organizations dedicated to addressing the state’s employment needs. Partners include state and local government agencies, community-based organizations, employers, and career and technical colleges.
WorkSource centers offer a variety of services to eligible individuals. The services of primary interest in this study are access to a resource room with computers and other technology, orientation to WorkSource services, job search planning, job search and placement assistance, initial assessments of skills and occupational interests, job search review program services, job referrals, provision of labor market information, and staff-assisted job matching. Note that these services are not restricted to UI claimants.1","The study included UI claimants without any UI-reported earnings in the third quarter of 2007. The study exclude those assigned to longer-term education or job training services. Among the eligible claimants, those who received at least some UI-provided employment services (either voluntarily or as required) in the following year served as the treatment group; those who never received any UI-provided employment services served as the comparison group. Both research groups were organized by gender, and within gender by consistency of employment in the baseline period, defined as the fourth quarter of 2005 through the second quarter of 2007. Those with UI-reported before-tax earnings in each of these seven baseline quarters were assigned to the continuous employment subgroup; those with at least one quarter of employment in the baseline quarters were assigned to the intermittent employment subgroup.
The authors estimated the impact of receiving WorkSource services on employment in quarters 3 and 4 of 2008 and earnings growth using UI administrative wage records.","Among men with intermittent baseline employment, WorkSource services were associated with an increase in the likelihood of being employed of 35 to 37 percent, and an increase in earnings over a six-month period of $1,449 to $1,493.
Among men with continuous baseline employment, WorkSource services were associated with an increase in the likelihood of employment of 20 to 24 percent, but had no statistically significant impact on earnings. 
Among women with intermittent baseline employment, WorkSource services were associated with an increase in the likelihood of employment of 27 to 28 percent, and increased the pre-post difference in earnings over a six-month period of $1,232 to $1,241.
Among women with continuous baseline employment, WorkSource services were associated with an increase in the likelihood of employment of 22 to 26 percent, but had no statistically significant impact on earnings.","The fact that the treatment group included some claimants who chose to participate in WorkSource job search services makes it difficult to attribute the observed differences between the groups to the services themselves, and not other factors. For instance, UI claimants who are more motivated to become reemployed might both be more likely to engage in job search activities and become reemployed. In addition, the observed differences between treatment and comparison group members, particularly among the intermittently employed group, in previous employment, earnings, UI benefit receipt, and union membership are so large that they are unlikely to be adequately controlled for in the impact estimation models.","","1Information in this section comes from Washington’s WorkSource website: https://fortress.wa.gov/esd/worksource/Employment.aspx."

The intervention included intensive counseling and developmental courses for first-time, full-time community college students whose late registration suggested a high risk of not persisting.
The study used administrative records to compare outcomes of a group of 270 students who were required to meet with an advisor and strongly encouraged to participate in one of six developmental courses with those of a comparison group of 174 students who received no counseling and were not advised to take developmental courses.
The study found that participation in one of the six developmental courses was significantly and positively associated with fall-to-spring semester persistence.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the author did not adequately account for existing differences between the treatment and comparison groups. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Mandatory Placement Project. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Des Moines Area Community College began a pilot of the Mandatory Placement Project in fall 2006 to improve students’ grades, credit completion, and persistence. The Mandatory Placement Project was piloted among students registering during the two-week period before classes started; a 2004 study at the college had identified such students as being at a particularly high risk for low levels of academic success and persistence. Additional eligibility criteria included being a full-time student who had never enrolled at Des Moines Area Community College before. Mandatory Placement students were required to meet with an advisor who strongly advised that students enroll in at least one developmental course. Mandatory Placement students could choose among six developmental course options: (1) The College Experience, (2) Study Strategies, (3) Learning Communities, (4) College Preparatory Reading, (5) College Preparatory Writing, or (6) College Preparatory Math. In addition to taking developmental courses, students were required to meet with an advisor to modify their course schedules or reenroll for the following semester.","The study used administrative records to compare credit completion and fall-to-spring semester persistence of students in treatment and comparison groups at Des Moines Area Community College, Ankeny Campus. During the two-week period before courses began, 278 eligible students who registered made up the treatment group and were required to meet with an advisor and strongly encouraged to participate in one of six developmental courses. The comparison group consisted of 174 eligible students who registered during the first week of classes. These students received no counseling and were not advised to take developmental courses. The authors used statistical techniques to estimate the effect of the program.","The study found that participation in one of the six developmental courses was significantly and positively associated with fall-to-spring semester persistence.","The author did not control for the previous academic achievement of students in the treatment group and students in the comparison group. Moreover, students registering before courses begin (who were included in the treatment group) are likely to differ systematically from students registering later (who were included in the comparison group) in unobservable ways, such as motivation. Therefore, the estimated relationship between participating in a developmental course and persistence may reflect underlying differences between the students being compared and not the effect of participating in a developmental course. For this reason, the study is not eligible for a moderate causal evidence rating.","",""

Using the annual Uruguayan National Household Survey with cross sectional data from 2006 and 2007, the authors compared school attendance and child labor for households who received the conditional cash transfer to a group of non-participating households who had similar characteristics.
The study found no statistically significant relationship between the conditional cash transfer program and school attendance. However, the study found a statistically significant relationship between the program and a reduction in child labor for females in the Montevideo region, but not for males in any region or females in the rest of the country.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not demonstrate that groups were similar at baseline. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to Ingreso Ciudadano; other factors are likely to have contributed.","Absence of conflict of interest.","Ingreso Ciudadano, a conditional cash transfer program, was implemented as part of the National Plan to Address the Social Emergency (PANES) in Uruguay from April 2005 to December 2007. The program provided a conditional cash transfer equivalent to $56 USD on a monthly basis to eligible households with amounts updated every four months. The payment was conditional on school enrollment and attendance as well as regular health status control for the children. Households were eligible to receive Ingreso Ciudadano if they were in the “first quintile of people below the poverty line” based on 2 criteria: a monthly per capita income of less than $51 USD and Critical Lack Index above a certain amount, based on the region of the country. In total, 59,808 households received Ingreso Ciudadano payments in 2006, and 65,531 received payments in 2007.","To test the impact of the Ingreso Ciudadano program, the authors used cross-sectional data from the 2006 and 2007 Uruguayan National Household Surveys.

The authors analyzed the average treatment effect on school attendance in separate analyses for the rural area of Montevideo and the urban areas of the country by gender and age (8 to 11 and 12 to 14). Similarly, the average treatment effect for child labor was analyzed separately by region (Montevideo and the urban areas of the country) and gender for children ages 6 to 14.","Employment/Child labor

Specifically, the study looked at links between parents’ attitudes toward science and participation in their children’s science education and the child’s opinion of the utility of science (called science task-value) and perception of his or her own science ability.
The study, conducted in four school districts in Illinois, used student survey data collected at the start and end of the school year and parent survey data collected in the middle of the school year. The authors analyzed changes in students’ perceptions from the beginning to end of the year, by gender, as well as differences in parents’ perceptions and behavior by the gender of the child and parent. The authors also conducted a series of regression analyses by gender to determine the relationship between parents’ involvement in their children’s science education and their children’s end-of-year perceptions.
The study found that boys had higher perceptions of their own science ability at the end of the school year than girls, though there was no difference in actual performance. Compared with parents of girls, parents of boys also had higher perceptions of the child’s science ability and of the value of science and were more likely to encourage an interest in science. There were some positive correlations between parents’ beliefs and actions and girls’ perceptions of science; however, some actions taken by mothers were found to be negatively correlated with boys’ perceptions of their science ability and their task-value beliefs about science. Even after controlling for mothers’ behaviors, mothers’ perceptions of their children’s science ability was a significant predictor of the children’s perceptions of their own ability.

Related reports examine outcomes at 21 months and 3 years post-intervention.
The program’s effectiveness was evaluated using a randomized controlled trial conducted in 10 states. This report examined the effects of the program on participants’ educational attainment, earnings, employment, and other outcomes measured through a survey conducted about 9 months after participants entered the study.
The study found statistically significant, positive impacts of the ChalleNGe program on employment, education, and training outcomes measured after 9 months.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is high because it is a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the effects estimated in this study are attributable to the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe program, and not to other factors.","","The National Guard Youth ChalleNGe program began in the early 1990s with a mission to target at-risk youth and equip them with the skills and training to have successful adult lives. To be eligible, youth must be 16 to 18 years of age, have dropped out of or been expelled from school, be unemployed, not be drug users, and not be heavily involved in the criminal justice system.
The 17-month program consists of a two-week Pre-Challenge phase, a 20-week Residential phase, and a one-year Post-Residential phase. Participants live in barracks-style housing (sometimes on a military base) in a very disciplined environment during the first two phases. They wear their hair short, are referred to as cadets, and wear military uniforms. In the Pre-Challenge phase, participants are oriented to the program’s rules and begin physical training. During the Residential phase, they participate in a number of different activities addressing eight core pillars: leadership/followership, responsible citizenship, service to community, life-coping skills, physical fitness, health and hygiene, job skills, and academic excellence. Most of their time is spent in an educational component that is usually geared toward receiving a General Educational Development (GED) certificate. During the Post-Residential phase of the program, after participants are placed in employment, education, or military service, they receive structured mentoring.","The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted at 10 program sites. In 2005 and 2006, about 3,000 eligible applicants were randomly assigned to either receive an offer to participate in the program (the treatment group) or to not receive an offer for the program in the current or future application cycles (the control group). For the 9-month survey, the authors attempted to survey a subsample of those originally randomly assigned (755 treatment and 446 control youth) and ultimately surveyed 648 treatment and 370 control youth. To estimate the effectiveness of the ChalleNGe program, the authors compared the outcomes of the treatment group with outcomes of the control group.
This study examined the effects of the ChalleNGe program on education, employment, and training outcomes, relative to the effects of other employment and training programs used by control group youth, measured about 9 months after random assignment. The study also examined outcomes on military enlistment, delinquency and criminal activity, health, sexual activity, and substance use.","The study found statistically significant, positive impacts of the ChalleNGe program on employment, education, and training outcomes measured after 9 months.
Nine months after randomization, 31 percent of youth in the treatment group were working full time compared to 21 percent of those in the control group. Fifty-one percent of youth in the treatment group were working any hours compared to 42 percent of those in the control group. These differences were statistically significant.
Youth in the treatment group were significantly more likely than youth in the control group to have earned a high school diploma or GED certificate (46 percent versus 10 percent).
Control group members were significantly more likely than youth in the treatment group to be in high school (36 percent compared to 16 percent) and significantly less likely to be enrolled in college courses (3 percent compared to 11 percent).
Thirty-three percent of youth in the treatment group had ever received job training compared to 23 percent of youth in the control group, a statistically significant difference.","Because this study only included youth who chose to apply for the program, these results cannot be assumed to apply to any youth who could be forced to attend the program. Youth who applied to the program may differ from other youth in a meaningful way. For example, youth who applied to ChalleNGe may have higher motivation than the “average” youth.
Not all youth who were randomly assigned to receive an offer to participate in the program did ultimately participate. However, youth were included in the treatment group regardless of whether they successfully completed the program. This could have reduced the estimated impact of the program. Additionally, sites were not randomly selected for participation in the study. Therefore, casual conclusions can only be drawn for the subset of sites that participated in this study and not the ChalleNGe program nationally.
The authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to education, employment, and earnings. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustment to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","California

Please click here to find CLEAR profiles of those studies.","","The WIA Youth Program was authorized by Title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 and was superseded by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), effective in July 2015. The Youth Program services, which remained essentially the same under WIOA, were designed to provide quality employment and training services to eligible workers. Administered through local workforce investment areas, the Youth Program served people 14 to 21 years old through core services; these included job placement assistance, skills assessments, and provision of information on the labor market. In addition, those unable to obtain a job through core services alone could receive intensive services—which included counseling and specialized assessments—and vouchers for attending training. Recipients of public assistance and other low-income people received priority for intensive and training services in local workforce investment areas in which program funds were limited. In addition, some local areas provided supportive services such as child care, transportation, and work-related financial assistance to those who qualified.","The author used a nonexperimental statistical approach called propensity score matching to create a comparison group of people who participated in WorkOne and were similar to WIA Youth Program participants in terms of demographic characteristics, including gender, age, educational attainment, race, and employment and earnings history.

The authors randomly assigned former prisoners to an employment program offering transitional job placement and other services or to a control condition providing a more limited set of services. Employment and earnings data were collected quarterly for three years and compared between the two groups, controlling for characteristics before random assignment.
The study did not find any statistically significant effects on employment in the sixth or eighth quarters after random assignment, nor on earnings in the sixth quarter or second year after random assignment.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we would be confident that any estimated effects would be attributable to the employment program and not to other factors. However, the study did not find statistically significant effects.","","The Center for Employment Opportunities (CEO) provided a comprehensive employment program for former prisoners. To reduce recidivism and improve labor market prospects, CEO provided former prisoners with temporary paid jobs working for New York City agencies and other services. Specifically, CEO’s services included a pre-employment class, a transitional job, job coaching, job development, a parenting class, and post-placement services. People placed into jobs worked in crews of about six participants in city and state agencies throughout New York City. Former prisoners were eligible to participate in the program if they had not worked in a CEO transitional job in the year before baseline; had not participated in New York State’s Shock Incarceration (or other small, special programs); and signed an informed consent form.","From January 2004 to October 2005, 977 ex-offenders were randomly assigned to either the CEO program or a control group, members of which received an abbreviated pre-employment class and access to job search resources. The authors compared raw mean differences between the treatment and control groups’ quarterly employment and earnings outcomes during the two years after random assignment, adjusting for baseline characteristics of sample members. Employment data came from New York State Unemployment Insurance wage records and earnings data came from the National Directory of New Hires database.","The study did not find any statistically significant findings on employment in the sixth or eighth quarters after random assignment, nor on earnings in the sixth quarter or second year after random assignment.","This profile was developed in collaboration with the Employment Strategies for Low-Income Adults Evidence Review, which focused its review on the outcomes measured in quarters 6 and 8 after random assignment. Another study on this intervention focused on annual outcomes and found that people assigned to CEO were 24.5 percentage points more likely to be employed during the first year after random assignment than people assigned to the control condition.

The authors used a nonrandom approach to select treatment and comparison students to include in their analysis. To measure the relationship between participation in a learning community and persistence, the authors used survey and administrative data from 13 community colleges to estimate a logistic regression.
The study found that 62 percent of learning community students persisted from freshman to sophomore year, compared with 57 percent of comparison group students. This difference was statistically significant.

The authors selected institutions at which at-risk students were well represented and that had learning communities meeting several criteria: the learning community programs were well established and had institutional evidence of effectiveness for academically underprepared students, they situated basic skill development within a broader academic context rather than simply linking several courses, and they captured variations in how learning communities were being adapted.","The study used a nonexperimental design. The authors selected two groups of students at each participating college: a treatment group of students who participated in a learning community during their first year of college and a comparison group of students who did not. Comparison students were similar to learning community students in terms of attributes and academic preparation and were enrolled in courses that were similar in content to those that were part of the learning communities. To estimate the relationship between participation in a learning community and persistence, the authors estimated a logistic regression using the following control variables: highest education credential, mother’s education level, age, gender, English as native language, U.S. citizenship, ethnicity, and student engagement.","The study found that 62 percent of learning community students persisted from freshman to sophomore year, compared with 57 percent in the comparison group.

In addition, the authors did not include controls for state. Because participating colleges were located in several states throughout the United States, it is important to control for state to account for differences in state-level educational policies, among other factors, that could influence persistence.

The study used a nonexperimental design to compare youth who received reentry services to a comparison group of youth who received traditional services in a neighboring county. Data came from the local juvenile court databases, probation and transitional coordinator files, and electronic records used by case managers to track client contacts.
The study found that there were no statistically significant differences between study groups in time to first reoffense or in number of criminal contacts with the justice system.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because all treated youth were in one county and all comparison youth were in another. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the after-care and reentry program; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","A developing body of literature demonstrates that orchestrated reentry services, tailored service provision, and mentoring relationships are effective program models in aiding justice-involved youth to successfully transition to the community and decreasing their rates of recidivism. The program under study included components of Juveniles Mentoring Program, Aftercare for Indiana through Mentoring, Intensive Aftercare Program and Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative, all previously studied juvenile justice reentry program models.
The program under study was implemented in an unnamed, mostly rural Midwestern county. To be eligible to participate in the program, youth had to be in an out-of-home placement for at least three weeks; this placement could be in a detention center, foster care, residential treatment unit, chemical dependency treatment unit, or a mental health facility. Staff selected youth for the program based on factors that increased the risk of transition difficulties, such as offending history, family circumstances, and time spent in out-of-home placement. The program had a three-phase design of offender assessment (service delivery and reentry planning while youth were in a facility), case planning (efforts to facilitate transition to home and prepare reentry through home community investigation and community-based services determination), and case management that integrated treatment and supervision from transition coordinators through check-ins to ensure mentoring and community-based services receipt for up to six months after release.","The study used a nonexperimental design to compare the recidivism outcomes of program participants in the county that implemented the program with the outcomes of a comparison group of youth who were returning from an at least three-week out-of-home placement to a neighboring county. Youth in the neighboring county were not offered the reentry services and participated in a standard supervised probation program. The authors estimated impacts through multivariate regression analyses with controls for demographic characteristics and offense history.","Results from the multivariate regression analyses demonstrated no significant differences in time to first criminal reoffense or number of criminal contacts with the justice system for those in the treatment versus comparison group.","The program participants and comparison youth came from different counties. It is possible that other policy changes at that county level occurred at the same time as the reentry program, or that policy changes occurred in response to an omitted third variable. For example, policing strategies might have been modified in the treatment county during this period, which would have affected the outcomes of interest irrespective of the reentry program. Therefore the study’s results cannot be attributed to the reentry program.","",""

Students in the Opening Doors learning communities took three linked courses during one semester and were provided tutoring and case management services.
The study was a randomized controlled trial. Eligible students were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which was offered the opportunity to participate in a learning community, or the control group, which was not allowed to enroll in a learning community. The primary data sources were a baseline survey on the background characteristics of students, student transcripts, and degree attainment information from the National Student Clearinghouse.
The study found that the treatment group earned significantly more credits than the control group, cumulatively across the program semester and the three follow-up semesters,. However, during that time, there were no significant cumulative differences between the two groups on registration for any courses, the number of semesters registered, or enrollment in either a two- or four-year college.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects would be attributable to the learning communities, and not to other factors.","","At Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn, New York, the Opening Doors learning communities program involved enrolling small cohorts of students in three linked courses during one semester. These learning communities involved an English course, a college-level course required for a specific major, and a one-credit freshman orientation class. The freshman orientation class was a seminar designed to reinforce the learning objectives of the other two courses and provide students practical information about careers in their selected majors. The instructor of this course also served as a case manager for the students in the learning community, meeting with faculty members to ensure the success of learning community students. In addition, each learning community member had a tutor who provided students with one-on-one tutoring; learning community students were also provided with $225 textbook vouchers. This study focused on four cohorts of students who participated in learning communities from fall 2003 to spring 2005.
To participate in the Opening Doors learning communities, students had to be first-time incoming freshman ages 17 to 34 who planned to attend college full-time during the day, and be enrolled in either a developmental or college-level English course. Although not a specific requirement for eligibility throughout program implementation, the program targeted low- and moderate-income students.","This study was a randomized controlled trial. Randomization occurred at the student level, separately for each cohort. Eligible students who consented to participate in the study filled out a baseline data form. Then, they were randomized to either the treatment group, which was offered the opportunity to enroll in a learning community, or the control group, which could not enroll in a learning community, but could access existing college services. There were 1,534 students in the study with 769 in the treatment group and 765 in the control group.
The authors used data from the baseline data form, student transcripts, and the National Student Clearinghouse for outcomes related to progress toward degree completion. Impacts were reported as the difference of means between the treatment and control groups, adjusted for cohort and the number of English tests passed at baseline. This study reported outcomes for four semesters: the program semester and three subsequent follow-up semesters.","The study found that the treatment group earned 2.4 more credits than the control group cumulatively across the program semester and the three follow-up semesters, which was a significant difference. However, in each individual follow-up semester, there were no significant differences between the groups on credits earned.
Across the program semester and three follow-up semesters, there were no significant cumulative differences between the two groups on registration for any classes, the number of semesters registered, enrollment in any college, or enrollment in any four-year college.","Kingsborough Community College provided extensive services to all students, so those in the control group might have had access to more services than a typical community college student at other schools. This could have attenuated the differences in service receipt between the treatment and control group students. Moreover, the authors noted that midway through the study period, Kingsborough opened a new academic advising center, which was aimed to improve the quality of academic advising across the college. These factors that are specific to Kingsborough might have decreased the ability to detect large program impacts over time.
The study authors performed multiple statistical tests on related outcomes in the progress toward degree completion domain, which makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated. Nevertheless, most differences are not considered statistically significant by CLEAR standards.","",""

If both programs were completely ineffective, and everyone stayed on their original upward-sloping wage trajectory, it would appear as though the FSET participants earned more 6 months after their exit dates. However, this would not be attributable to receiving FSET services; it would be caused by the different elapsed time across the groups (12 months for FSET participants versus 7 months for Employment Services participants).

The study used a randomized controlled trial design in which 366 active duty military service members or veterans with moderate-to-severe TBI were randomly assigned to receive either cognitive-didactic rehabilitation, which focuses on addressing cognitive deficits, or functional-experiential rehabilitation, which emphasizes performance of real-life tasks. Primary outcomes were measured using in-person evaluations or structured telephone interviews.
The study found no significant differences in return to work or school or functional independence between the two types of rehabilitation.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that any estimated effects would be attributable to the difference between the cognitive-didactic and functional-experiential treatments and not to other factors. However, the study did not find statistically significant effects between the two treatments.","","Cognitive-didactic rehabilitation targets attention, memory, executive function, and pragmatic communication through paper-and-pencil and computer-based tasks, with the idea that addressing cognitive deficits will result in generalized functional improvement. Patients practiced these tests one-on-one with therapists in daily sessions lasting 1.5 to 2.5 hours. Therapists treating those in the cognitive-didactic rehabilitation group drew patients’ attention to their errors and prompted them to think through what had caused the error and how to correct it.
Functional-experiential rehabilitation focuses on performing real-life tasks in groups and natural environments to rebuild functional behaviors through practice. Patients participated in daily sessions lasting 1.5 to 2.5 hours. Therapists treating those in the functional-experiential rehabilitation group tried to anticipate patients’ mistakes and minimize them through providing instructional cues.
Both groups received treatment for 20 to 60 days and received assistance with activities of daily living, physical therapy, rehabilitation counseling, family/patient education, social work support services, and psychological treatment as necessary.","The study was conducted in four U.S. Veterans Administration acute inpatient TBI rehabilitation programs in Minneapolis, Minnesota; Palo Alto, California; Richmond, Virginia; and Tampa, Florida. Participants were military members or veterans age 18 or older experiencing moderate-to-severe TBI within the past six months. Participants were included in the study if it was anticipated that they needed 30 or more days of acute rehabilitation. Participants who had prior inpatient acute rehabilitation for the current TBI or a history of severe conditions that impaired brain functioning were excluded from the study.
The authors randomly assigned 366 eligible military members or veterans to participate in one of two hospital-based interdisciplinary TBI rehabilitation programs; 184 were randomly assigned to receive cognitive-didactic rehabilitation and 182 were randomly assigned to receive functional-experiential rehabilitation. The authors collected data on return to work or school and functional independence through in-person evaluations or structured telephone interviews with patients conducted approximately one year after random assignment. Authors also collected data on a number of secondary outcomes including memory problems, motivation, and social withdrawal. The authors estimated the impacts of the program by comparing the average outcomes of patients in the two groups.","There were no significant differences in return to work or school or functional independence between the two treatment groups.","The study was a well-implemented randomized controlled trial testing two different treatments. Thus, the lack of any statistically significant differences in outcomes between patients receiving the treatments implies they were equally effective. However, neither was compared against a no-treatment control group, because that was deemed unethical. The authors noted that the overall rates of independent living and return to work or school at the one-year follow-up were 59 percent and 37 percent, respectively. They remarked that this was noteworthy considering that none of the patients was capable of doing either of those at the time of study enrollment.","",""

The authors randomly assigned 44 firms to either a treatment group, whose employees could receive employment retention services through Cleveland Achieve, or a control group. The authors collected data on employee turnover directly from firms and employment and earnings data from state Unemployment Insurance (UI) records.
Two years after random assignment, the study did not find statistically significant differences in the turnover rates, employment rates, or earnings of employees in Achieve firms compared with employees in firms that did not have access to Achieve services.

This means we are confident that any estimated effects would be attributable to the Achieve program, and not to other factors. However, the study found no statistically significant impacts.","","The ERA project was introduced in 1999 as a nationwide exploration of factors that helped welfare recipients not only find employment but retain their positions and advance in their careers. Cleveland was one of 16 sites across the United States to receive funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to implement a program intended to improve welfare recipients’ employment outcomes.
The Achieve program was designed to help low-wage employees retain jobs. Run by a community-based social service organization, the program delivered services in the workplace and consisted of three components: case management, weekly life-skills learning sessions, and training for supervisors. Staff met individually with clients to discuss workplace and housing problems as well as transportation and child care concerns. Weekly sessions and workshops addressed topics such as time management, goal-setting, budgeting, and credit repair. The program also trained the supervisors of low-wage workers.","Given the high probability of service spillover to other employees, the firm was the unit of random assignment in this study. The evaluation randomly assigned 44 employers/firms (as opposed to employees), half to the treatment and half to the control condition. Employers/firms in the nursing sector were targeted because of the high turnover rates in the long-term nursing industry. To be eligible for random assignment, employers/firms needed to have employed at least 15 workers earning less than $13 per hour and hired within the past six months.
The authors estimated program impacts on employee retention with the same employer using data from the randomly assigned firms over the 180 days following random assignment. After firms were identified (but before random assignment), the authors conducted research information sessions at each employer to invite employees to participate. A total of 697 employees consented to participate and provided baseline data.

This means we are not confident that any estimated effects would be attributable to employer subsidies.","","At the time of this study, the Work Opportunity Tax Credit and Welfare-to-Work Tax Credit (which was subsequently merged with the Work Opportunity Tax Credit) provided employers with tax credits for hiring disadvantaged workers. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit provided employers with a one-year tax credit of 40 percent of the employee’s wages, up to a maximum of $2,400, for welfare recipients and other target groups working at least 400 hours per year. The Welfare-to-Work tax credit applied to employers hiring workers who had been welfare recipients for at least 18 months and worked at least 400 hours per year. This two-year tax credit was 35 percent of the employee’s wages in the first year, up to a maximum of $3,500, and 50 percent of wages in the second year, up to a maximum of $5,000. Employers had to request certification of their eligible employees to receive the tax credits. To become certified, workers had to complete paperwork confirming their eligibility, which the employer submitted to the state.","This nonexperimental study examined the total earnings and number of quarters employed in the first and second years after a worker started a job. The authors conducted two analyses. First, they analyzed the effect of the tax credits overall by comparing the outcomes of 444 certified workers with those of 3,525 eligible but uncertified workers; all workers were employed through temporary help services. Second, they analyzed the effect of employment by a temporary help service by comparing the outcomes of 314 certified workers employed through a temporary help service with those of 10,642 certified workers hired directly through an employer. Because the temporary help service firms—rather than the end employers—would collect the tax credit, the authors hypothesized that workers employed by temporary help service firms would have different earnings than workers employed directly by an employer. The authors used a propensity-score matching model to ensure that the workers being compared in both analyses were initially similar on race, age, and gender.","The study found no statistically significant relationships between Work Opportunity Tax Credit or Welfare-to-Work Tax Credit certification and earnings or quarters employed for either the first or second year following a worker starting a temporary help service job.
The study also found no statistically significant relationships between being a certified worker employed through a temporary help service and earnings or quarters employed.","Although the authors used propensity-score matching to make the groups as similar as possible given the data available, the matching model did not include controls for previous earnings or employment of the workers. Although some models included a firm-level measure of the previous year’s average quarterly earnings at the firm, CLEAR requires inclusion of an individual-level measure of employment and/or earnings measured more than 12 months before the intervention in order to meet the guidelines for a moderate causal evidence rating. Therefore, the study could not receive a moderate causal evidence rating.","",""

The study was a randomized controlled trial in which eligible youth were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which participated in a teen court, or to the control group, which participated in the traditional juvenile justice system. The authors compared outcomes for the two groups using administrative data.
The study reported no differences in recidivism outcomes for teen court youth and those in the traditional juvenile justice system.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate for some outcomes and low for other outcomes. This means we have little confidence that any estimated effects would be attributable to the teen court program. However, the study did not find statistically significant effects.","","Youth in the treatment group went through a teen court program in one of four Maryland counties. In general, teen courts are run by youth who act as peers, juries and advocates with the support of adult volunteers. Teen courts are held in real courtrooms, and most youth offenders are required to complete community service hours. Youth offenders typically tell their side of the story, but must also accept responsibility for how their actions affected others. This report did not provide data on the specific features of the Maryland teen court program.","This study randomly assigned 83 youth to the teen court group and 85 youth to the control group, which interacted with the traditional juvenile justice system. The authors administered a survey to youth in both groups three to four months after program intake and collected administrative data from the Department of Juvenile Services and Public Safety records on recidivism over an 18-month follow-up period. The authors compared outcomes between the treatment and control groups, controlling for the race, gender, and age of participants.","The study found no statistically significant differences in self-reported delinquent behavior or belief in conventional rules between the two study groups when adjusting for baseline characteristics of participating youth.
In addition, the study found no statistically significant differences in recidivism, as measured by administrative data, or a number of other self-reported behaviors between the study groups when not adjusting for baseline characteristics.","Although it was based on a randomized controlled trial, the study had high attrition and is therefore evaluated against the CLEAR evidence guidelines for nonexperimental analyses. The authors included controls for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and grade level in the analyses of self-reported delinquent behavior and belief in conventional rules; therefore, these outcomes received a moderate causal evidence rating. However, the authors did not include these controls in the analyses of recidivism outcomes or other self-reported behaviors. Therefore, the analyses of these outcomes received a low causal evidence rating. This means we are not confident that any estimated effects were attributable to the teen court; however, the study found no statistically significant effects.
In addition, the authors noted that subsequent calculations indicated their analysis suffered from low power, making it difficult to detect statistically significant differences between the study groups. Based on the point estimates of the findings, however, they concluded that traditional juvenile processing generally outperformed the teen court.","",""

The study used propensity scores based on state and county administrative records to match juveniles who participated in the drug court to similar juveniles in the year before the introduction of the drug court. The author used regression analysis to estimate the relationship between participation in the juvenile drug court and the number and rate of arrests 18 and 24 months following the initial petition.
The study found no statistically significant relationship between the juvenile drug court and recidivism.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the study did not account for other changes that could have taken place at the same time as the introduction of the drug court and affected juvenile recidivism. This means we are not confident that any estimated effects would be attributable to the juvenile drug court, and not other factors. However, the study found no statistically significant effects.","","The Suffolk County juvenile drug court included three phases. The first phase was a program orientation during which youth were required to attend appointments, school, and weekly court appearances, and participate in drug testing at least three times per week. After being drug-free for one month, participants moved on to the second phase, which required court appearances twice a month, drug testing at least three times per week, and part-time employment (if the youth were old enough). After being drug-free for an additional consecutive eight months, participants moved onto the community acclamation phase, which included monthly court appearances and drug testing at least once per week. To graduate and receive reduced supervision and monitoring, participants had to participate in treatment, attend required meetings, and abstain from drug use for a year of clean time across all phases. The types of treatments included individual therapy, outpatient treatment, intensive outpatient treatment, 30-day diagnostic inpatient treatment, and short- and long-term residential treatment.","The study took place at the Suffolk County Juvenile Treatment Court on Long Island, New York. The juvenile drug court was instituted in 2002, and the study used state and county administrative data from the year before program inception through 2004 to examine its effects. The study used a propensity-score matching method to select a comparison group of youth who entered the court system in 2001. Youth in this group had characteristics similar to the group of youth who participated in the drug court after the establishment of the court in 2002. Specifically, they had similar race, gender, living situation, charge type (assault or drug), indicator for prior petitions, and number of prior family member neglect cases. After matching, 133 drug court participants and 180 comparison group members remained in the analysis.
The author analyzed data from administrative sources, including the Suffolk County Family Court, New York State Family Court, Unified Case Management System, New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services, and New York State Family Treatment Court Universal Treatment Application, which included data on program performance such as drug test results, court appearances, warrants, sanctions, rewards, and final program status. The author estimated the relationship between participation in the drug court and recidivism by comparing outcomes of the matched groups, controlling for the propensity score.","The study found no statistically significant relationship between juvenile drug court and the rate or average number of new arrests.","The study used a sophisticated nonexperimental design involving a matching technique that produced a comparison group that was well matched to the treatment group on relevant characteristics. However, because the comparison group entered the court system in the year before the start of the county’s juvenile drug court program and the treatment group entered the court system after the start of the program, we cannot separate the effects of the drug court from effects caused by other changes in policies or practices occurring at about the same time. For instance, if the county adopted a no-tolerance arrest policy at the same time as the drug court, this could have resulted in more new arrests, independent of the drug court.","",""

The Portland site was one of four in Oregon that participated in the Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) project.
The authors randomly assigned 634 Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) applicants and recipients to either a treatment group that received Career Builder services or a control group that could participate in other employment-related programs in the community. The authors analyzed data from Unemployment Insurance (UI), TANF, and Food Stamps administrative records.
The study did not find any statistically significant effects on employment, earnings, and public benefits receipt outcomes one and two years after program entry.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we would be confident that the estimated effects would be attributable to the Career Builders program, and not to other factors. However, the study did not find any statistically significant effects.","","The ERA project was introduced in 1999 as a nationwide exploration of factors that help welfare recipients not only find employment but retain their positions and advance in their careers. Portland, Oregon, was one of 16 sites across the United States to receive funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to implement a program intended to improve welfare recipients’ employment outcomes. The Career Builders program in Portland operated through the North and East offices of Oregon’s Department of Human Services.
Participants in the Career Builders program underwent extensive screenings to pinpoint barriers to employment. Each participant was assigned not only a case manager, but also an employment specialist, mental health specialist, and community resource expert. The program provided direct referrals to education and training programs and offered peer support classes to help participants establish a resource network. Participants worked individually with an employment specialist to develop a long-term career plan and to discuss issues that arose when they found employment.","From May 2002 to February 2003, the study randomly assigned 634 eligible individuals to either the treatment group, which received the Career Builders program, or a control group, which could participate in the regular TANF program. Eligible individuals were TANF recipients and applicants who had experienced a gap in employment or received public assistance in the two years before qualifying for TANF. More than 95 percent of the study sample was female, with an average age of 30. Slightly more than one-third did not hold a high school diploma or general equivalency degree and nearly half (48 percent) had worked fewer than 12 months in the past three years.
The authors estimated employment and earnings impacts by comparing UI wage records of treatment and control group members over the two years after random assignment. The authors also calculated program impacts for benefits receipt measures, including whether participants received TANF or Food Stamps, through two years after random assignment using TANF and Food Stamps administrative records.","The study did not find any statistically significant effects on employment, earnings and public benefits receipt outcomes.","Participants were intended to meet individually with an employment specialist to develop a long-term career plan and to discuss issues that arose after they found employment. However, due to lack of funds and support from administrators and some staff, post-employment services were not implemented. As a result, the Career Builders program provided services highly similar to those available to people in the comparison condition.","",""

The study compared the wages of employed youth who were matched to employment through DSYODP with the wages of employed youth who were eligible for the DSYODP but had secured employment through other means.
The study found that average weekly wages of youth matched to employment through DSYODP were significantly higher than wages of youth who secured employment through other means.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it was based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the DSYODP; however, other factors might also have contributed.","","DSYODP built on the experience of the U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration’s Youth Offender Demonstration Project, which aimed to prevent delinquency among youth offenders and at-risk youth by helping them obtain long-term employment with adequate wage levels. DSYODP served employers in need of qualified workers; an intermediary connected employers with ex-offenders and at-risk youth ages 18 to 25. The intermediary screened youth and matched them with prospective employers to increase the likelihood that the youth would satisfy employers’ needs, prioritizing matching youth with positions that paid retention wages. The intermediary also provided follow-up services after placement. The intermediary recruited youth through youth development organizations, which provided the youth with a variety of services at the time of recruitment.","The authors compared the wages and quarters of employment of youth who were matched to employment through the DSYODP and those of employed youth who were eligible for the DSYODP but secured employment through other means. The authors used statistical methods to ensure that the groups were similar in terms of gender, race, education level, marital status, offender status, and parenthood status of the youth, among other characteristics. Although two centers in different locations implemented the demonstration, the analysis included only youth enrolled in the Washington, D.C., center.","The study found that average weekly wages of youth matched to employment through DSYODP were about 48 percent higher than those of youth who secured employment through other means.
There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of quarters youth placed through DSYODP had been employed, relative to youth not placed through DSYODP.","The analysis of impacts of DSYODP on earnings and employment focused specifically on the differences in outcomes between youth who secured employment through DSYODP and those who secured employment through other means. Both groups contained DSYODP participants and could thus receive many services in addition to the job matching, such as resume writing, computer training, self-esteem building, clothing assistance, job shadowing, child care, housing and transportation services, and more. It is unclear to what extent the receipt of these services varied between the two groups; thus, it is possible that differences in receiving these services, and not the job matching alone, drove the differences in observed outcomes. In addition, the analysis included only youth who were employed. Thus, the results might not apply to the full set of DSYODP participants.","",""

The study found that, compared with those who did not take part in the program, the employment rate was significantly lower for those who took part in the TANF/VIEW program, but the TANF/VIEW group earned significantly more educational or training credentials.

The authors used a nonexperimental statistical approach called propensity-score matching to create an Employment Services group that was similar in terms of demographics, education, and labor market history.

The study found that those who took part in the TANF/VIEW program were significantly more likely to complete an educational or training credentials than those who did not take part in the program (0.4 percentage points higher).","Although the authors accounted for many underlying characteristics of the groups being compared, which could also influence their outcomes, the authors’ decision to define the groups based on their date of program exit rather than program entry is problematic. For example, suppose that the TANF/VIEW and Employment Services participants were on identical wage trajectories before receiving services from their respective programs and that the average length of participation in TANF/VIEW services was six months, whereas that for Employment Services was one month. At the conclusion of participation, they exited the program.
If we compared the groups’ earnings 6 months after their recorded exit dates, we would be looking at TANF/VIEW participants’ earnings about 12 months after they started receiving services and Employment Services participants’ earnings about 7 months after they started receiving services. If both programs were completely ineffective and everyone stayed on their original upward-sloping wage trajectory, it would appear as though the TANF/VIEW participants earned more 6 months after their exit dates. However, this would not be attributable to receiving TANF/VIEW services; it would be caused by the different elapsed time across the groups (12 months for TANF/VIEW participants versus 7 months for Employment Services participants). Therefore, studies defining the groups based on exit date, rather than entry date, cannot receive a moderate causal evidence rating.","",""

The study randomly assigned nearly 2,000 eligible claimants to either the treatment group, which could receive REA services, or the control group, which could not access the same REA services. Those in the treatment group were required to participate in the services to retain their UI eligibility. The authors estimated the program’s effectiveness by analyzing state administrative records on UI payments and information from a follow-up survey of a subsample of study participants.
The study found no statistically significant impacts of REA on UI benefits receipt, employment, or earnings.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high for the UI benefits receipt outcomes because it is based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. For the employment and wages outcomes, the quality of evidence presented in this report is moderate.","","Since its inception in 2005, 40 states have implemented the REA initiative to encourage rapid reemployment of UI claimants through a combination of in-person eligibility reviews and employment-focused case management. In North Dakota, UI claimants at the time of the REA initiative were required to participate in eligibility assessments and reemployment services. UI claimants were contacted by mail within two weeks of their claims informing them of the services and were expected to undergo reemployment reviews every four weeks as long as they remained unemployed. The REA initiative represented a change of timing, duration, and mode of contact from existing services. Those selected for REA were contacted by telephone within one day of filing for UI and underwent reemployment reviews every 10 days as long as they remained unemployed. To be eligible, claimants could not be attached to a job and could not be a union member, federal employee, or military employee. In addition, eligible claimants had to be North Dakota residents and have satisfied a work search requirement.","From April 2005 through May 2006, North Dakota randomly assigned nearly 2,000 eligible UI claimants to either the treatment group, which was contacted for reemployment services through the REA initiative, or to a control group, which received services as usual. The authors subsequently limited their analysis of administrative data to those who had filed an initial claim from April 1 to December 31, 2005.
The study analyzed UI benefits receipt outcomes using administrative records and employment and earnings information from a follow-up survey. The authors presented results from multivariate regressions controlling for age, gender, race, ethnicity, education, and likelihood of exhausting benefits. The UI benefits outcome regressions also controlled for total 2005 wages; the employment and earnings regressions additionally controlled for the number of months between the follow-up interview and the participant’s first claim.","The study found no statistically significant impacts of the REA initiative on UI benefits receipt, employment, or earnings.","The existing services available to control group members were relatively similar to the REA services offered to the treatment group members. This could have made it difficult to detect statistically significant impacts.
The follow-up survey, from which employment and earnings outcomes were drawn, appeared to have a very low response rate, with only about one-third of the randomized sample represented. Therefore, the analyses of employment and earnings outcomes are not eligible for a high causal evidence rating. However, the authors included an extensive set of control variables in their regression models, making these analyses eligible for a moderate evidence rating.","",""

This means we would be confident that any estimated effects would be attributable to Project GATE and not to other factors. However, the study did not find statistically significant effects. Outcomes measured with survey data received a low evidence rating because there is high attrition and insufficient adjustment for differences in previous employment and earnings history.","This study was conducted in part by staff from Mathematica Policy Research, which administers CLEAR. Therefore, the review of this study was conducted by an independent consultant trained in applying the CLEAR causal evidence guidelines.","Project GATE was a demonstration project that operated in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Minneapolis–St. Paul and northeastern Minnesota; and three cities in Maine from fall 2003 to summer 2005. It was open to anyone older than 18 who resided in one of the participating sites and had a business idea. Applicants had to provide information on their personal characteristics and business ideas. Very few people were denied participation based on their business ideas or their qualifications for starting a business (three applicants whose business ideas were not appropriate for federal funding were deemed ineligible).
As part of the demonstration, the authors randomly assigned 2,095 Project GATE applicants to a treatment group that could participate in Project GATE and 2,103 applicants to the control group that could not participate but could access other employment services available in the community. Members of the treatment group underwent an assessment interview with a Project GATE assessment counselor and together they selected the most appropriate services to meet the participant’s self-employment needs. The counselor referred the participant to an appropriate service provider—a One-Stop Career Center, nonprofit community-based organization, or small business development center—that offered entrepreneurship training, one-on-one business counseling, and help applying for business loans.
Study participants were 42 years old on average. Slightly more than half were white and non-Hispanic, and about 30 percent were black and non-Hispanic. On average, sample members had completed two years of postsecondary education. Slightly less than half had received UI in the past year, and more than one-third received it when they applied. Slightly more than one-third had been self-employed in the past, and about one-fifth were self-employed when they applied.
The authors obtained UI wage record data for all participants for four quarters following random assignment to measure employment, earnings, and UI receipt. The authors also conducted two follow-up surveys (6 and 18 months following random assignment) to measure employment and earnings, from both self-employment and wage and salary employment, as well as public benefit receipt. The authors compared the outcomes of treatment and control group members in each quarter following random assignment.","","Employment. The study found no statistically significant effects of Project GATE on employment during the first four quarters after random assignment using data from UI wage records.
Earnings. The study found no statistically significant effects of Project GATE on earnings in any of the four quarters after random assignment, based on UI wage record data.
Public benefit receipt. The study found no statistically significant effects of Project Gate on UI benefit receipt in any of the four quarters after random assignment, based on UI wage record data.","Because both follow-up surveys had high attrition, analyses involving these follow-ups were reviewed as nonexperimental designs. In their analysis of the survey data, the authors did not account for existing differences between the groups before random assignment. These existing differences between the groups—and not Project GATE—could explain the observed differences in outcomes.

This analysis included 2,254 TAA participants in Virginia who exited the program from July 2004 to June 2005.","Employment. The study found that TAA participants were significantly less likely to be employed than members of the comparison group, with an employment rate that was 6.2 percentage points lower in the second quarter and 5.6 percentage points lower in the fourth quarter after program exit.
Education and/or training attainment and completion. The study found that TAA participants were significantly more likely than members of the comparison group to earn an educational credential during the program or within one year of program exit (a difference of 67 percentage points).","The authors presented unadjusted treatment effects in the study. This profile reports adjusted effects obtained directly from the authors.
Although the authors accounted for many underlying characteristics of the groups being compared, which could also influence their outcomes, the authors’ decision to define the groups based on their date of program exit rather than program entry is problematic. For example, suppose that the TAA participants and the comparison group members (who participated in the employment services program only) were on identical wage trajectories before receiving services from their respective programs, and that the average length of participation in TAA services was six months, whereas that for the employment services program was one month. At the conclusion of participation, they exited the program.
If we compared the groups’ earnings 6 months after their recorded exit dates, we would observe TAA participants’ earnings about 12 months after they started receiving services and comparison group members’ earnings about 7 months after they started receiving services. If both programs were completely ineffective and everyone stayed on their original upward-sloping wage trajectory, it would appear as though the TAA participants earned more 6 months after their exit dates. However, this would not be attributable to receiving TAA services; it would be caused by the different elapsed time across the groups (12 months for TAA participants versus 7 months for comparison group members). Therefore, studies defining the groups based on exit date rather than entry date cannot receive a moderate causal evidence rating.","",""

The authors used data from a survey administered after one year of program participation to compare the prevalence of entrepreneurial activities among IPD participants compared with program applicants who were not selected to participate in IPD.
The study found statistically significant positive relationships between participating in the IPD program and several business development activities and outcomes.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not demonstrate that the IPD and comparison groups were comparable before the program, nor did they control for potential differences in their analysis. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the IPD program; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The IPD program paired dislocated workers with multidisciplinary teams from business, engineering, and design arts programs at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The teams worked with the dislocated workers to develop products and start businesses based on their product ideas. Participants worked with students in technology entrepreneurship courses and faculty advisors to prepare business and marketing plans, develop prototypes, seek investments, create products, file for and/or obtain patents, and work to launch a profitable business.
Participants were recruited through various forms of media, and eligibility was determined from interviews and questionnaires. Among 212 applicants, 11 participants were deemed eligible because they were dislocated workers or new workers, lived in the area, and had the interest and ability to participate based on several additional screening characteristics. All participants were male, had varying degrees of college education, and most had business training and/or had previous involvement in entrepreneurial activities (3 had been self-employed and 5 had parents with businesses).
IPD participants and a group of unselected applicants were surveyed a year following the program to assess key business development tasks. Seven IPD participants (64 percent) responded, and nine applicants (22 percent of those targeted) responded. The authors compared the outcomes of IPD participants and nonselected applicants and tested the statistical significance of differences in outcomes.","","The study found positive and statistically significant relationships between IPD participation and several early and high-level business development activities, as well as higher rates of employee hiring and making a profit.","The study did not demonstrate that the IPD participants and non-selected applicants were similar to one another before the IPD program began in their age or race and ethnicity. Neither did the analysis include control variables for these characteristics. This means that any observed differences in outcomes between the IPD participants and non-selected applicants might reflect underlying differences between the two groups, and not the effect of the intervention.

The authors used administrative data to match Initiative participants to a comparison group of nonparticipants released from the same rehabilitation facilities. The authors compared recidivism rates among program participants and the comparison group.
The authors reported a statistically significant relationship between participation in the Targeted Re-Entry Initiative and higher rates of re-arrest at one of the three sites studied, and no statistically significant correlations at the other two sites.

This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America Targeted Re-Entry Initiative; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The Boys and Girls Clubs of America Targeted Re-Entry Initiative consisted of 90 days of programming inside juvenile correctional facilities and re-entry case management provided by Boys & Girls Club staff during and following incarceration. Programming varied widely by site, but was generally focused on character and leadership development, health and life skills, arts, sports, fitness and recreation, and education and career development.","Targeted Re-Entry Initiative participants from three juvenile correctional facilities—McLaughlin Youth Center in Alaska, Alexander Youth Center in Arkansas, and Ethan Allen School in Wisconsin—composed the treatment group that is the focus of this review. The comparison group in Alaska was composed of youth released from McLaughlin Youth Center before the center implemented comprehensive targeted re-entry services. In Arkansas and Wisconsin, the comparison groups were drawn from nonparticipants from the same communities and juvenile detention centers who were released in the same period as the treatment group youth.
The authors estimated program impacts by comparing recidivism rates among program participants at each site after the intervention against those of the comparison group from the same site. Recidivism was measured by the percentage of youth with subsequent arrests and subsequent convictions, and was analyzed overall and separately for felony and misdemeanor offenses. The authors also calculated a recidivism score that reflected the frequency and seriousness of subsequent offenses.","The study did not find any statistically significant effects on recidivism in Arkansas or Wisconsin.
The authors reported a statistically significant relationship between participation in the Targeted Re-Entry Initiative at the McLaughlin Youth Center in Alaska and rates of re-arrest that were, on average, 15 percentage points higher than among comparison group members.","This is a nonexperimental study based on comparing youth who participated in the initiative to a comparison group that did not participate in the program. In Alaska, the comparison group comprised youth involved in the juvenile justice system before the implementation of the initiative. In Arkansas and Wisconsin, the comparison groups comprised youth who were released from correctional facilities during the same time period, but did not participate in the Boys & Girls Clubs of America Targeted Re-Entry Initiative. The study showed that treatment and comparison groups differed on important demographic characteristics before the treatment group participated in the intervention. The authors did not control for those differences in the analyses, so the reported estimates may reflect pre-existing differences between program participants and the comparison groups, and not the effect of the re-entry initiative.","",""

The author used statistical models to estimate the effects of the program.
The study found no significant relationship between the Tekoporã program and the number of children in the household who participated in non-domestic labor. However, the program was significantly related to decisions between school and work, with a decrease in the probability that children would “only work” or “neither work nor attend school.”

Households were eligible if they lived in a priority area defined by the Geographic Prioritization Index, were poor according to the multidimensional quality of life index (ICV index), and had at least one child under 15 years of age or a pregnant woman in the household. To receive the cash transfer, children under 15 had to maintain an 85 percent school attendance rate. Children up to 5 years of age had to regularly visit a health center. Households received $12 USD cash transfers each month, with an additional $6 USD per child under 15 in the household for up to 4 children (Soares, Ribas, & Hirata, 2008).","The author used a nonexperimental design to compare the labor and school attendance outcomes of children ages 4 to 14 who received the conditional cash transfer with those who did not receive it, using data from a program eligibility questionnaire and a follow-up survey. The treatment group consisted of 3,500 households in the five rural districts that received the cash transfer. The comparison group consisted of 776 households in the five participating districts that did not receive the cash transfer and 1,160 households in two districts that did not participate in the program. The author used data from the 2005 program eligibility questionnaire (Ficha Hogar) as a baseline measure. The author collected follow-up data with an evaluation survey (Encuesta de Evaluación) from January to April 2007. The Ficha Hogar contained data for approximately 3,000 children and the follow-up evaluation survey contained data for approximately 2,000 children. Outcome measures included the number of children in the household who participated in non-domestic labor, and children’s participation in work and/or school (neither work nor go to school, only work, only go to school, or work and go to school). The author had baseline data for the child labor outcome; however, prior school attendance was measured using an item on the follow-up survey.

Education (School participation/enrollment)
The study found no statistically significant relationship between the Tekoporã program and the decision that children would only attend school.","The study employed a difference-in-difference approach. For studies using difference-in-differences designs, authors must demonstrate equivalent trends between treatment and comparison groups.

The study used data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) from 1984, 1990, 1996, and 2001. The analysis attempted to determine how much of the difference in wages between men with and without disabilities was explained by background characteristics and how much was not; the portion that was not was interpreted as the effect of discrimination.
The study found that neither the employment nor wages of men with disabilities improved relative to men without disabilities following passage of the ADA. Instead, employment and wage differentials both increased. However, the unexplained portion of the wage gap narrowed significantly after the ADA, consistent with a decrease in discrimination, among other explanations.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the author did not establish the comparability of men with and without disabilities before passage of the ADA. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the ADA. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The ADA prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities. Enacted in July 1990 and first implemented in January 1992, the law bars employers from discriminating against people with disabilities in all aspects of employment, including hiring, firing, wages, and training. The legislation also requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to help employees with disabilities complete the functions of their jobs, provided the accommodations do not impose undue hardship on the employer. Reasonable accommodations may include adjusting work schedules or equipment, providing qualified readers or interpreters, or modifying facilities to improve accessibility. When the ADA first went into effect in 1992, it applied to government employers and private employers with 25 or more employees; an addendum in 1994 extended coverage to private employers with 15 or more employees.","The author examined the impact of the ADA on the employment and hourly wages of men with disabilities ages 18 to 25 using SIPP data from 1984, 1990, 1996, and 2001. The analysis attempted to determine how much of the difference in wages between men with and without disabilities was explained by background characteristics and how much was not; the portion that was not was interpreted as the effect of discrimination. Background characteristics included demographic, human capital, family, and socioeconomic characteristics, as well as self-reported health status. The procedure adjusted for the selection of men with disabilities into employment. This analysis was conducted for each year of data to assess changes in the unexplained portion of the employment and hourly wage gaps between men with and without disabilities before and after passage of the ADA.","Before passage of the ADA, the gap in employment rates between men with and without disabilities increased 45 percent (from 20.8 to 30.2 percent) and the gap in log hourly wages increased 78 percent (from 3.7 to 6.6 percent).
Following passage and implementation of the ADA, there was no improvement in either employment or wage levels for men with disabilities, and the gap in employment rates and log hourly wages between men with and without disabilities increased. The study found that most of the increase in the gap was due to an increase in the portion of the gap that can be explained by background characteristics.
The portion of the wage gap between men with and without disabilities that could not be explained by background characteristics narrowed significantly after passage of the ADA. This might have been due to a decrease in discrimination, provided that unmeasured factors such as productivity did not change during this period.","The study did not examine or control for different pre-intervention trends in labor market outcomes among men with and without disabilities. Thus, the findings might reflect pre-existing differences in the levels and trends of employment rates and earnings of men with and without disabilities before passage of the ADA; these differences could influence employment and wages even in the absence of the ADA.","",""

[Adult sample]","The study’s objective was to examine the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) Adult Program’s impact on workers’ employment and earnings in 12 states.
The authors analyzed administrative data to compare the employment and earnings outcomes of people receiving different tiers of WIA Adult Program services with two different matched comparison groups for 16 quarters after program entry.
The study found that WIA Adult Program services had positive impacts on earnings and employment in most quarters examined. Those WIA Adult Program participants who received training earned more and were more likely to be employed than those who received only core and intensive services.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it was based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the WIA Adult Program services, but other factors might also have contributed.
The report also examined the impacts of WIA Dislocated Worker services; that profile is available here.","","The WIA Adult Program was authorized by Title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 and was superseded by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), effective in July 2015. The Adult Program services, which remained essentially the same under WIOA, were designed to provide quality employment and training services to eligible workers. Administered through local workforce investment areas, the Adult Program served all people ages 18 years and older through core services; these included job placement assistance, skills assessments, and provision of information on the labor market, among other services. In addition, those unable to obtain a job through core services alone could receive intensive services—which included counseling and specialized assessments—and vouchers for attending training. Recipients of public assistance and other low-income people received priority for intensive and training services in local workforce investment areas in which program funds were limited. In addition, some local areas provided supportive services such as child care, transportation, and work-related financial assistance to those who qualified.","The study compared earnings and employment outcomes for 16 quarters after program entry among three different groups: (1) WIA Adult Program participants compared with individuals who registered for Unemployment Insurance (UI) or Employment Services (ES); (2) WIA Adult Program participants who received only core and/or intensive services compared with UI or ES registrants; and (3) WIA Adult Program participants who received core and/or intensive services compared with participants who received training. For each of these comparisons, the authors used a statistical technique called propensity-score matching to create comparison groups that were as similar as possible based on calendar quarter of program entry; demographic characteristics, including gender, age, educational attainment, and race or ethnicity; and employment and program participation history. The authors used WIA, UI, and ES administrative data from 12 states to estimate differences in employment and earnings between each pair of groups after adjusting for demographic characteristics and preprogram employment and earnings. The authors presented results by gender.
The authors matched 89,551 participants in the WIA Adult Program to one or multiple comparison cases from a comparison sample of almost 3 million people. Of the WIA Adult Program participants, 65,482 received core and/or intensive services and 17,651 received training.","The study found that participants who received services through the WIA Adult Program earned significantly more in the four years after program entry than UI and ES recipients. Among females, WIA Adult Program participants earned $500 to $600 more per quarter. Among males, WIA Adult Program participants earned $300 to $700 more per quarter.
In addition, employment levels for participants who received services through the WIA Adult Program were significantly higher than the matched comparison group of UI and ES recipients throughout the study. The employment rate difference was highest in the first year after WIA Adult Program entry, but remained statistically significant in the remaining quarters, with WIA Adult Program females and males 4 to 8 percentage points and 5 to 7 percentage points more likely to be employed, respectively.
The subset of participants in the WIA Adult Program receiving core and/or intensive services had significantly higher employment levels and earned significantly more than the matched comparison group of UI and ES recipients in all quarters following program entry for both males and females.
WIA Adult Program participants receiving training had significantly higher earnings and employment outcomes than core and/or intensive services participants in some, but not all, quarters following program entry.","In some of the states included in the analysis, the core services offered through the WIA Adult Program were very similar to services offered through ES. Therefore, comparisons between the WIA Adult Program participants and the matched comparison groups in those states might be smaller than those in states where the contrast between WIA and ES services was more distinct.","Connecticut

It focused on the key services the programs provided to school dropouts, challenges related to implementing program activities, and strategies to address and resolve these challenges.
The researchers conducted one- to two-day visits to each program site, during which they interviewed principals or program directors, instructors, counselors, records administrators, and participating students. They also gathered individual participants’ record data and aggregate reports of key outcomes.
The study found that incoming participants’ academic ability varied greatly and that large class sizes sometimes limited the extent to which teachers could adapt their lessons to meet diverse needs. Program staff tried to develop relationships with participants and help them resolve personal problems, but found it difficult to address the most serious problems.

The study found no statistically significant effects on employment, earnings, or public benefit receipt eight years after the program began.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial.

However, the study did not find statistically significant effects.","","The New Hope demonstration was designed to increase total income to the poverty threshold by providing monthly earnings supplements to participants who worked at least 30 hours per week. Participants also received low-cost health insurance (58 percent of particiapnts) if their employers did not provide it. In addition, parents with children younger than 13 received child care subsidies. Participants who were unable to find full-time employment were placed in full- or part-time subsidized community service jobs with local nonprofit organizations, with a requirement for consistent attendance and job performance. Each community service job lasted up to 6 months, and participants could hold community service jobs for up to 12 total months.","The study was conducted in two low-income areas in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Potential participants were recruited for an orientation session, during which they learned about the New Hope program and the random assignment study. They were randomly assigned after completing a questionnaire on their background characteristics.

The authors investigated two tax reforms, the first in 1986 and the second in 1993. The 1986 reform levied an additional tax of 10 percent on LSDs (framed as a penalty) that were not rolled over into tax-preferred funds. The 1993 reform required LSDs to provide an automatic rollover option and increased tax withholding rates on cash LSDs.
The authors used data from the 1993 Current Population Survey Employee Benefit Supplement to analyze the effects of the 1986 tax reform and data from the 1992–2004 Health and Retirement Study to assess the effect of the 1993 tax reform.
Treating the tax rate on LSDs as a penalty in the 1986 reform framework increased LSD rollovers by 16 to 32 percentage points for the average individual in the study. The 1993 reforms led to a 10 to 13 percentage point increase in rollovers for the average individual in the study.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is low. This means that we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the intervention alone; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","","","Framing an additional tax rate on LSDs as a penalty led to an increase in LSD rollovers of 16 to 32 percentage points for the average individual in the study
The 1993 tax reform was associated with a 12 to 13 percentage point increase in rollovers among those ages 35 to 54. Among those ages 55 to 64, the policy corresponded to a 10 percentage point increase in rollovers.","In the analysis of the 1986 reform, the changes in penalties applied only to those younger than 59 when they received the LSD. Thus, the study compared people ages 60 and older with those younger than 60. Because savings behavior is likely to evolve differently in different age groups, regardless of additional tax reforms, the comparison and treatment groups used in this portion of the study were not comparable.
In the analysis of the 1993 reform, people receiving an LSD before the law change were compared with those who received an LSD after the change. But there was no reason to believe that the timing of the LSD was random and people who received LSDs at different times might differ. Thus, the comparison and treatment groups used in this portion of the study were not comparable.","",""

Supported employment interventions use a combination of employment and health services and supports to improve employment and other outcomes.
The authors analyzed data from seven sites, each of which implemented a distinct supported employment intervention using a randomized controlled trial. At each site, researchers interviewed participants in person twice yearly and collected weekly employment data.
The study found that the programs were effective at improving 24-month employment outcomes for people with severe mental illness. Relative to treatment group members with different severe mental illnesses, people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia who received supported employment services were more likely to be employed after receiving those services.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is moderate. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the supported employment interventions, but other factors might also have contributed.","","Supported employment interventions use a combination of employment and health services and supports to improve employment and other outcomes for people with psychiatric conditions. The supported employment programs in this study shared five core features:
Integrated services delivered by a multidisciplinary team that met at least three times per week to plan and coordinate employment interventions, psychiatric treatment, and case management
Placement into competitive employment
Jobs tailored to participants’ career preferences
Immediate job search beginning at program entry
Ongoing vocational support","The study team recruited volunteers for the study. Candidates who responded to outreach efforts—self-referral, family referral, word of mouth, and advertisements—were considered eligible if they had a qualifying diagnosis, had exhibited symptoms for a sufficient period, were age 18 or older, had expressed willingness to work, and had provided written informed consent. A total of 1,648 eligible participants were randomly assigned to the treatment group, which received supported employment services, or the control group, which received a comparison condition that varied by site (exact breakdowns by group are unknown). The analysis sample consisted of 1,273 study participants (648 treatment and 625 control).
Researchers interviewed all participants at baseline and twice yearly thereafter, in addition to collecting weekly employment records. They computed impacts on competitive employment, defined as a position in a privately held, socially integrated setting not reserved for people with disabilities that paid at least minimum wage, at 24 months after random assignment, for the sample as a whole and for participants diagnosed with schizophrenia.","The study found that, relative to the control group, people with a diagnosis of severe mental illness in the supported employment treatment group were more likely to be competitively employed 24 months after random assignment.

Results for earnings of participants ages 22 to 26 were presented separately and are the focus of this review.
The effectiveness of the programs was evaluated using a matched comparison group design. Outcomes were examined up to 10 quarters after WIA participants entered the Adult or Dislocated Worker programs.
The study found that participants in the WIA Adult Program under age 26 earned significantly more than those in the comparison group every quarter after program entry. In the WIA Dislocated Worker program, participants under age 26 began earning significantly more than those in the comparison group a year following program entry.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this study is moderate. This means we have confidence that the effects estimated in this study are attributable at least in part to WIA programs. However, as in any nonexperimental study, other factors not accounted for in the analysis might have contributed to the estimated effects.","","Passed in 1998, the Workforce Investment Act introduced a one-stop service delivery system (now referred to as American Job Centers) to provide WIA services and other workforce services in the same location. WIA services can be categorized into three levels: (1) core services, which include outreach, job search and placement assistance, and labor market information; (2) intensive services, which include comprehensive assessments, development of individual employment plans, counseling, and career planning; and (3) training services, which include occupational and basic skills training. All WIA participants are eligible to receive core services. Once individuals receive core services, staff may recommend that they receive intensive services. Some participants may then receive training. The WIA Adult Program targets all adults, with priority to low-income adults where funds are limited. The WIA Dislocated Worker program targets individuals who have lost their jobs.","The study used a matched comparison group design to examine the effects of WIA services on individuals who began participating in WIA in July 2003–June 2005 from 12 states (Connecticut, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin). The authors used an extensive list of control variables to match WIA participants to Unemployment Insurance (UI) claimants or individuals who registered with their state’s labor exchange (“Employment Service [ES] participants”). The matching variables included calendar quarter of program entry (WIA, UI, or ES), gender, age, education, race/ethnicity, local labor market, employment history in the two years before program entry, program participation history (WIA, UI, and ES), current and prior receipt of benefits through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, and time since layoff when available. The effects of the Adult and Disconnected Worker programs for individuals ages 22 to 26 were calculated separately as the average difference between the earnings of the WIA program participants and the matched comparison group up to 10 quarters after program entry. Effects were also estimated separately for females and males. The sample included about 30,000 females and 25,000 males who participated in the WIA Adult program, and about 6,000 females and 7,000 males who participated in the WIA Dislocated Worker program. In addition to estimating the overall effect of any WIA program participation, the authors compared the impacts of (1) WIA core/intensive participants to those of a comparison group and (2) WIA training participants to those of WIA core/intensive participants.","In all quarters, female participants under age 26 in the WIA Adult Program earned about $500 more per quarter than females in the comparison group. The difference in earnings was statistically significant in every quarter, up to 10 quarters after WIA entry. The estimated impact of the WIA Adult Program was smaller for male participants under age 26, leveling off at around $400.
In the WIA Dislocated Worker program, females and males under age 26 began earning significantly more than members of the comparison group after the first year following program entry. Ten quarters after program entry, female participants under age 26 in the Dislocated Worker Program earned about $200 more than females in the comparison group, and male participants under age 26 earned about $300 more than males in the comparison group.
Quarterly impacts for employment (measured as having positive quarterly earnings) were not presented for this subgroup as a whole.","The statistical matching procedure included an extensive list of variables, including employment history in the two years before program entry, to ensure that the WIA participants and their matched comparison group members were similar on observed characteristics. The authors provided ample evidence that the matching procedure did result in comparable groups. However, as with any nonexperimental design, it is possible that unobservable factors, such as individual motivation, might have contributed to the estimated effects.","",""

The Los Angeles site was one of 16 nationwide to participate in the Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) project. (See the CLEAR review of the final report here.)
The authors randomly assigned almost 1,200 single-parent Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) recipients to either a treatment group, which received Enhanced Job Club (EJC) services, or a control group, which received Traditional Job Club (TJC) services. The authors collected employment and earnings data from Unemployment Insurance (UI) records and used automated TANF and Food Stamps databases to obtain benefits receipt information.
The study found that, 18 months after random assignment, there were no statistically significant differences between EJC and control group members’ employment, earnings, or public benefits receipt.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that any estimated effects would be attributable to the EJC and not to other factors. However, the study found no statistically significant impacts.","","The ERA project was introduced in 1999 as a nationwide exploration of factors that help welfare recipients not only find employment but retain their positions and advance in their careers. Los Angeles was one of 16 sites across the United States and one of 2 in California to receive funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to implement a program intended to improve welfare recipients’ employment outcomes.
The EJC was designed to help TANF recipients find work in their desired careers, rather than quickly accepting a job that did not necessarily align with long-term career goals. The program combined job search skills, career planning, and a step-down approach to employment that started the job application process with the highest-paying position accessible to the participant. If unsuccessful at the highest level, participants then focused on positions offering opportunities for advancement; those who still had not found a position after four weeks of intensive job searching targeted part-time roles that would enhance their skills while providing them time to participate in educational programs. By contrast, TJC, the standard model, provided job search assistance and encouraged recipients to accept the first available position, regardless of whether it aligned with the person’s career goals.","Single-parent Los Angeles TANF applicants and recipients were randomly assigned to either EJC, the treatment group, or TJC, the control group, from June to September 2004. Most (91 percent) of the participants were women; their average age was 30; 57 percent had one or two children; 56 percent were Hispanic and 35 percent were black; most participants spoke English and 15 percent spoke Spanish; slightly more than half of the members did not have a high school diploma or a General Education Development certificate.
The authors estimated program impacts for employment and earnings 18 months after random assignment to the program using UI data. They also estimated EJC’s impact on public benefits receipt 18 months after random assignment using TANF and Food Stamps records.","The study did not find any statistically significant differences between EJC and control group members on employment, earnings, or public benefits receipt 18 months after random assignment.","The authors noted that the study design compared an experimental program (EJC) designed to improve long-term job retention outcomes with a standard program (TJC) that had already been proven to produce short-term employment and earnings impacts. They hypothesized that this could explain the lack of statistically significant differences in outcomes between the two groups.","",""

[Dislocated worker sample]","The study’s objective was to examine the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) Dislocated Worker Program’s impact on workers’ employment and earnings in 12 states.
The authors analyzed administrative data to compare the employment and earnings outcomes of people receiving different tiers of WIA Dislocated Worker Program services with two different matched comparison groups for 16 quarters after program entry.
The study found that WIA Dislocated Worker Program services had positive impacts on earnings and employment in most quarters examined. However, those WIA Dislocated Worker Program participants who received core and/or intensive services had significantly better earnings and employment outcomes in the first seven quarters than those who also received training.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it was based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the WIA Dislocated Worker Program services, but other factors might also have contributed.
The report also examined the impacts of WIA Adult Program services; that profile is available here.","","The WIA Dislocated Worker Program was authorized by Title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 and was superseded by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), effective in July 2015. The Dislocated Worker Program services, which remained essentially the same under WIOA, were designed to provide quality employment and training services to eligible workers. Administered through local workforce investment areas, the Dislocated Worker Program served people who had been laid off from employment, including those whose employers had closed permanently and who were unlikely to return to their previous industry of occupation. Eligible workers could receive three tiers of services through WIA. Core services were available to everyone and included job placement assistance, skills assessments, and provision of information on the labor market, among other services. Those unable to obtain a job through core services alone could receive intensive services—which included counseling and specialized assessments—and vouchers for attending training. In addition, some local areas provided supportive services such as child care, transportation, and work-related financial assistance to those who qualified.","The study compared earnings and employment outcomes for 16 quarters after program entry among three different groups: (1) WIA Dislocated Worker Program participants compared with people who registered for Unemployment Insurance (UI) or Employment Services (ES), (2) WIA Dislocated Worker Program participants who received only core and/or intensive services compared with UI or ES registrants, and (3) WIA Dislocated Worker Program participants who received core and/or intensive services compared with participants who received training. For each of these comparisons, the authors used a statistical technique called propensity-score matching to create comparison groups that were as similar as possible based on calendar quarter of program entry; demographic characteristics, including gender, age, educational attainment, and race or ethnicity; and employment and program participation history. The authors used WIA, UI, and ES administrative data from 12 states to estimate impacts on earnings between the treatment group and each of the comparison groups after adjusting for demographic characteristics and preprogram employment and earnings. The authors presented results by gender.
The authors matched 61,566 participants in the WIA Dislocated Worker Program to one or more comparison cases from a comparison sample of almost 3 million people. Of the WIA Dislocated Worker Program participants, 42,218 received core and/or intensive services and 13,331 received training.","The study found that participants who received services through the WIA Dislocated Worker program earned significantly more in each quarter from 7 to 16 quarters after program entry than UI and ES recipients. Among females, WIA Dislocated Worker Program participants earned $100 to $400 more per quarter. Among males, WIA Dislocated Worker Program participants earned $100 to $350 more per quarter.
Employment levels for those who received services through the WIA Dislocated Worker Program were significantly higher than the matched comparison group of UI and ES recipients in every quarter after the first year following program entry. Among females, the difference gradually increased from 2 to 8 percentage points higher. Among males, the difference ranged from 1 to 6 percentage points higher.
The subset of participants in the WIA Dislocated Worker Program receiving core and/or intensive services had significantly higher employment levels throughout the follow-up period and earned significantly more than the matched comparison group of UI and ES recipients in almost every quarter after program entry for both males and females.
Both males and females who received training through the WIA Dislocated Worker Program had lower quarterly earnings and were less likely to be employed in quarters 1 through 7 than those who received only core and/or intensive services. There were no statistically significant differences in earnings or employment between these two groups after quarter 7.","In some of the states included in the analysis, the core services offered through the WIA Dislocated Worker Program were very similar to services offered through ES. Therefore, comparisons between the WIA Dislocated Worker Program participants and the matched comparison groups in those states might be smaller than those in states where the contrast between WIA and ES services was more distinct.","Connecticut

VISION provided job search assistance and post-employment services to unemployed Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) applicants.
The study used a randomized controlled trial to assign TANF applicants eligible for welfare-to-work programs to either VISION or the state’s typical welfare-to-work program, Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS), from May 2002 to May 2004. To estimate differences in outcomes between the two study groups, the authors retrieved data from unemployment insurance wage records, TANF and Food Stamps administrative records, and a 12-month follow-up survey.
The study found that people in the VISION group received, on average, $365 more in TANF benefits and $160 more in Food Stamps than those in the JOBS group during the first year after random assignment.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to VISION, and not to other factors.","","The VISION program in Salem provided job search assistance and post-employment services to unemployed TANF recipients. The program was run by the local welfare agency and a community college and operated out of a One-Stop Career Center. Participation was typically mandatory and enforced by sanctions. Job search assistance included job placement and workshops on job retention and career paths. Staff helped clients develop and regularly revisit a personal development plan to identify and prepare for a job that interested them. A case manager from the local welfare office could authorize supportive services. VISION staff reportedly devoted most of their time to pre-employment services and helped clients gain access to public assistance.","At two welfare offices, evaluators randomly assigned TANF applicants eligible for welfare-to-work programs to either VISION or the state’s typical welfare-to-work program, JOBS, from May 2002 to May 2004. The study randomly assigned 1,820 people during the two years. The authors restricted the analysis sample to 1,504 single parents. Data on employment and earnings were available from unemployment insurance wage records for all study participants for the first year after random assignment. Data on public assistance receipt from TANF and Food Stamps administrative records during the first year were available only for the 977 participants randomly assigned by September 2003. The evaluation included a survey 12 months after random assignment administered to all participants who met the following criteria: randomly assigned from May to October 2003, 18 years old or older, and spoke English or Spanish. The fielded survey sample included 418 participants, of whom 300 responded to the survey. The authors used regression analysis to estimate differences in outcomes across the VISION and JOBS groups.","The study found that people in the VISION group received, on average, $365 more in TANF benefits and $160 more in Food Stamps during the first year after random assignment than did the JOBS group. These differences were significant at the 5 percent level.","The study authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to short-term benefits receipt. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","",""

Earlier reports presented impact findings over a shorter period.
Career Academies are schools within schools that are organized around one occupation or industry. Employer partners help design the curriculum and provide work-based learning experiences for students. The effectiveness of Career Academies was evaluated using a randomized controlled trial conducted in nine high schools located in or near urban school districts. The evaluation included approximately 2,000 students.
The study reported statistically significant, positive impacts on average monthly earnings, average hours worked per week, and average hourly wages over the eight years following scheduled high school graduation. However, there were no statistically significant differences in educational attainment of the two groups.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated impacts are attributable solely to Career Academies, not other factors.","","Career Academies were first established some 45 years ago and have become a widely used high school reform initiative. They are designed to keep students engaged in school and improve their employment and educational outcomes. Students apply for admission into Career Academies during 8th or 9th grades (depending on the rules of the program to which they are applying). Career Academies have three distinguishing features, and the study authors pointed out that a true Career Academy must exhibit all three:
They are organized as small learning communities, or schools within schools. They typically serve 150 to 200 students from grades 9 or 10 through grade 12. This smaller size fosters a more personalized learning environment.
The curriculum is organized around one career, occupation, or industry and combines academic and technical aspects relevant to the career.
The academies offer work-based learning experiences, often through partnerships with local employers. These can include summer employment, internships, and mentoring.","The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted in nine high schools located in or near large urban school districts. Districts served a substantially higher percentage of African American and Hispanic students and a higher percentage of low-income families compared with school districts nationally. They also had higher rates of high school dropout and unemployment. All study participants applied for admission in one of the Career Academies. Because there were more applicants than the programs could serve, a lottery system was used to assign applicants to Career Academies. Approximately 55 percent of the applicants were randomly assigned to a Career Academy and formed the treatment group; the rest of the applicants enrolled in general education and formed the control group. The study examined labor market participation and educational attainment in the eight years following the participants’ scheduled high school graduation dates.","There were no statistically significant differences in any of the educational attainment outcomes between the treatment and control groups.
The authors found sustained, statistically significant impacts of Career Academies on average monthly earnings over the eight years following students’ scheduled graduation dates. Over the period one to four years after scheduled high school graduation, Career Academies students earned an average of $1,358 per month, compared with $1,225 in the control group (a difference of $133). The impact was even larger (about $216) over the period five to eight years after scheduled high school graduation, with Career Academies students earning an average of $2,112 per month, compared with $1,896 in the control group.
Although the components of monthly earnings—the number of months employed, hours worked per week, and hourly wages—were greater for Career Academies students than control students one to four years after scheduled graduation, the differences were only marginally statistically significant five to eight years after scheduled graduation.
The labor market impacts of Career Academies were more concentrated among young men; the monthly real earnings for young men who attended Career Academies were $2,558, compared with $2,197 for the control group, measured five to eight years after scheduled graduation.","The study was a well-conducted randomized controlled trial. The study’s authors estimated multiple related impacts on labor market participation; performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. CLEAR confirmed that the main impacts on average monthly earnings remained statistically significant after making a multiple comparisons adjustment.","Baltimore, Maryland

The study used administrative records to compare the outcomes of low-income adults who took part in the DRS program with outcomes of a nonexperimental matched group of adults who did not take part in the program.
The study found that DRS participants had higher employment and credential completion rates compared with those of people who did not participate in the program.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not ensure that the groups compared were similar before program participation. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to DRS; other factors are likely to have contributed.
This study also examined the effectiveness of other workforce development programs. Please click here to find CLEAR profiles of those studies","","The Vocational Rehabilitation program administered by DRS is designed to help disabled veterans find and keep employment. Program services include job training, skills coaching, and job search assistance.","Using data from program administrative records, Unemployment Insurance records, the Wage Record Interstate System, and the community college system, the authors compared education and employment outcomes of those who took part in the Vocational Rehabilitation program administered by DRS with outcomes of those who did not take part in the program (both groups participated in an employment services program). The authors compared the two groups on employment two and four quarters after program exit, and on the percentage of each group that had earned an educational credential during the program or within one year of program exit. This analysis included 6,128 DRS participants in Virginia who exited the program from July 2004 to June 2005.","Employment. The study found that DRS participants were significantly more likely to be employed than members of the comparison group, with an employment rate that was 20.0 percentage points higher in the second quarter and 18.2 percentage points higher in the fourth quarter after program exit.
 Education and/or training attainment and completion. The study found that DRS participants were significantly more likely than members of the comparison group to earn an educational credential during the program or within one year of program exit (a difference of 6.2 percentage points).","The authors presented unadjusted treatment effects in the study. This profile reports adjusted effects obtained directly from the authors.
Although the authors accounted for many underlying characteristics of the groups being compared, which could also influence their outcomes, the authors’ decision to define the groups based on their date of program exit rather than program entry is problematic. For example, suppose that the DRS participants and comparison group members were on identical wage trajectories before receiving services from their respective programs and that the average length of participation in DRS services was six months, whereas that for the employment services program was one month. At the conclusion of participation, they exited the program.
If we compared the groups’ earnings 6 months after their recorded exit dates, we would observe DRS participants’ earnings about 12 months after they started receiving services and comparison group members’ earnings about 7 months after they started receiving services. If both programs were completely ineffective and everyone stayed on their original upward-sloping wage trajectory, it would appear as though the DRS participants earned more 6 months after their exit dates. However, this would not be attributable to receiving DRS services; it would be caused by the different elapsed time across the groups (12 months for DRS participants versus 7 months for comparison group members). Therefore, studies defining the groups based on exit date, rather than entry date, cannot receive a moderate causal evidence rating.","",""

The study randomly assigned 5,898 eligible claimants to one of two treatment groups, which received REA services of varying intensity, or the control group. Those in the treatment groups were required to participate in the services to retain their UI eligibility. The authors estimated the program’s effectiveness by analyzing state administrative records on UI payments and information from a follow-up survey of a subsample of study participants.
The study found that UI claimants in the more-intensive treatment group claimed fewer weeks of UI benefits and were less likely to have an overpayment detected. There were no significant impacts on employment or earnings for either treatment group.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it is a randomized controlled trial with different selection processes for the treatment and control groups, but the authors controlled sufficiently for baseline characteristics in the analysis. This means we have some confidence that the estimated effects are attributable to REA, although other factors might also have contributed.","","Since its inception in 2005, 40 states have implemented the REA initiative to encourage rapid reemployment of UI claimants through a combination of in-person eligibility reviews and employment-focused case management. Minnesota implemented two different dosages of REA: either one REA counseling session or up to four sessions on a monthly basis. Services were provided at 12 different One-Stop Career Centers (now known as American Job Centers) in the state, concentrated in the Minneapolis, St. Paul, Duluth, and St. Cloud areas.
The Minnesota REA initiative targeted participants at moderate risk of exhausting UI benefits; that is, those with profiling scores in the middle third of the distribution. To be eligible, UI claimants had to have an active UI claim and payment status and have no hold or denial on claims due to a nonmonetary determination.","From April 2005 through March 2006, Minnesota randomly assigned 5,898 eligible UI claimants into one of two treatment groups, which could access REA services at different levels of intensity, or to a control group, which did not have access to REA but could access other existing services in the community.
The study analyzed UI benefits receipt outcomes using administrative records and employment and earnings information from a follow-up survey administered at least six months after the initial claim. For UI benefits receipt outcomes, the authors estimated multivariate regressions controlling for age, gender, race, ethnicity, education, veterans’ status, disability status, years in current occupation, number of eligible claim weeks allowed, and county-level quarterly unemployment in 2004 and 2005. For employment and earnings outcomes, the authors estimated similar models that also controlled for the UI profiling score.","The study found that UI claimants in the more-intensive treatment group, which could receive up to four REA sessions, had fewer UI weeks claimed and compensated than the control group, a statistically significant difference of 1.2 weeks. In addition, the proportion of claimants in the more-intensive treatment group with some overpayment detected was 3.8 percentage points less than the control group, a statistically significant difference.
The study found no statistically significant impacts of either treatment group on earnings, either at the participants’ first jobs within six months of initial claim or their jobs held at the time of the follow-up interview.","Although the study was designed as a randomized controlled trial, the treatment and control groups were selected using different methods. These differences undermine the key characteristic that supports causal inference in random assignment designs—that there are no systematic differences between research groups. The authors show that there were statistically significant differences between the treatment and control groups on several important characteristics, including previous earnings, which indicate the randomization was unsuccessful. However, the authors included sufficient control variables to mitigate this concern.","",""

The study found that increasing the amount of training per employee by 10 hours per year led to an increase in current productivity of 0.6 percent.

Completing the survey was mandatory for all Portuguese firms with at least 100 employees. Specifically, the data included a panel of 1,500 manufacturing firms in Portugal from 1995 through 1999, for a total of 5,501 firm-year observations.
Using generalized method of moments, the authors estimated a structural model in which the parameter of interest was the internal rate of return to the firm of providing an additional hour of training per employee. To estimate the components of the model, they used a first-difference instrumental variables approach that controlled for firms’ unobservable and time-invariant characteristics. To account for possible correlation between input choices and transitory productivity or cost shocks, the authors used instruments to statistically account for current differences in inputs using lagged values of inputs.","The authors’ preferred model found that increasing the amount of training per employee by 10 hours per year led to an increase in current productivity of 0.6 percent. Forgone productivity accounted for less than 25 percent of the total cost of training.","The authors used a sophisticated statistical method to estimate the returns to training. This method involved the use of instrumental variables to account for possible correlations between firms’ input choices and productivity or cost shocks. Although the authors did not report the results of a test of instrument strength directly, which is required for such an approach to receive a moderate causal evidence rating, the report acknowledged that the instruments the authors used were weak. Therefore, the study cannot meet the criteria for a moderate causal evidence rating.","",""

The study used administrative records to compare the outcomes of low-income adults who took part in the DBVI program with outcomes of a nonexperimental matched group of adults who did not take part in the program.
The study found that DBVI participants had higher employment and credential completion rates compared with those of people who did not participate in the program.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not ensure that the groups compared were similar before program participation. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to DBVI; other factors are likely to have contributed.
This study also examined the effectiveness of other workforce development programs. Please click here to find CLEAR profiles of those studies.","","The Vocational Rehabilitation program administered by DBVI is designed to help blind and visually impaired adults find and keep employment. Program services include job training, job placement assistance, support for medical procedures, provision of adaptive equipment, and support for job site accommodations.","Using data from program administrative records, Unemployment Insurance records, the Wage Record Interstate System, and the community college system, the authors compared education and employment outcomes of those who took part in the Vocational Rehabilitation program administered by DBVI with outcomes of those who did not take part in the program (both groups participated in an employment services program). The authors compared the two groups on employment two and four quarters after program exit, and on the percentage of each group that had earned an educational credential during the program or within one year of program exit. This analysis included 230 DBVI participants in Virginia who exited the program from July 2004 to June 2005.","Employment. The study found that DBVI participants were significantly more likely to be employed than members of the comparison group, with an employment rate that was 18.3 percentage points higher in the second quarter and 25.4 percentage points higher in the fourth quarter after program exit.
Education and/or training attainment and completion. The study found that DBVI participants were significantly more likely than members of the comparison group to earn an educational credential during the program or within one year of program exit (a difference of 4.1 percentage points).","The authors presented unadjusted treatment effects in the study. This profile reports adjusted effects obtained directly from the authors.
Although the authors accounted for many underlying characteristics of the groups being compared, which could also influence their outcomes, the authors’ decision to define the groups based on their date of program exit rather than program entry is problematic. For example, suppose that the DBVI participants and comparison group members were on identical wage trajectories before receiving services from their respective programs and that the average length of participation in DBVI services was six months, whereas that for the employment services program was one month. At the conclusion of participation, they exited the program.
If we compared the groups’ earnings 6 months after their recorded exit dates, we would observe DBVI participants’ earnings about 12 months after they started receiving services and comparison group members’ earnings about 7 months after they started receiving services. If both programs were completely ineffective and everyone stayed on their original upward-sloping wage trajectory, it would appear as though the DBVI participants earned more 6 months after their exit dates. However, this would not be attributable to receiving DBVI services; it would be caused by the different elapsed time across the groups (12 months for DBVI participants versus 7 months for comparison group members). Therefore, studies defining the groups based on exit date, rather than entry date, cannot receive a moderate causal evidence rating.","",""

The study found that participation in the REM program was associated with an increase in the likelihood that jobseekers were employed in quarters following program participation.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate for employment and earnings outcomes because it was based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design.

The authors noted they did not have access to data on ex-offender status and thus did not account for it in their analysis.

The study was a randomized controlled trial in two districts in Columbia (San Cristobal and Suba). The authors compared the differential effects of receiving the cash transfer on outcomes for those in the treatment group versus those in the control group.
The study found that students in grades 6-10 who received the basic treatment worked significantly fewer hours in the last week than students in the control group. The study did not find any significant differences in school attendance or school enrollment between students receiving the basic treatment and the control group.

The program included three variations of the cash transfer. The first CCT was a “basic” treatment that provided $30,000 pesos (USD $15) for 80 percent school attendance in a month. Students were removed from the program if they did not pass their grade level, did not make the attendance requirement for two consecutive months, or were expelled. The second CCT was a “savings” treatment that provided a payment of $20,000 pesos on a bimonthly basis, and $10,000 pesos deposited into a savings account that was available when students were preparing for the next school year, if they reached the attendance target. Students who met the attendance requirement each month also received an additional $100,000 pesos at the end of the school year. The third CCT, “tertiary,” was conditional on graduation and moving on to higher education and not school attendance. Students received a monthly subsidy of $20,000 pesos and also received $600,000 pesos upon graduation and enrollment in a tertiary institution. The basic and savings treatments were available to students in San Cristobal while the basic and tertiary treatments were available to students in Suba.","The study used a randomized controlled trial and stratified children on locality (San Cristobal and Suba), gender, type of school (private or public), and grade level. The inclusion criteria for the study included the completion of at least grade 5 but not yet completed grade 11, and the students’ family must have been from the two bottom categories of the poverty index in Columbia, the System of Identification for Social Assistance Beneficiaries (SISBEN). The students from San Cristobal were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups (basic or savings), or the control group. The treatment group consisted of 6,875 students and the control group consisted of 4,072 students. In Suba, students were assigned to one of two treatment conditions (basic or tertiary), or the control group. Specifically, children who had completed grades 6-8 were assigned the basic treatment, and those in grades 9-11 were assigned to the tertiary treatment. The treatment group consisted of 2,857 students and the control group consisted of 3,505 students. However, due to budgetary constraints, the study authors chose to collect data only in the 68 schools that had the largest number of registered children, which reduced the total possible sample to 9,768 students.
Child labor outcomes included the number of hours worked in the previous week and the allocation of time between work and school. School participation outcomes included school enrollment and school attendance. Data sources included SISBEN surveys, program registration information, administrative records from the Secretary of Education for enrollment information, baseline and follow-up student surveys, and observation data for attendance. The data were analyzed by comparing the treatment groups to one another, as well as to the control by study site.","Employment/Child labor
The study found that students in grades 6-10 who received the basic treatment worked .38 fewer hours in the last week than students in the control group. This was statistically significant.
Education (School participation/enrollment)
The study did not find any significant differences in school attendance or school enrollment between students receiving the basic treatment and the control group.","The authors note that due to budget constraints they only collected data from the 68 schools with the largest registered numbers of children, occurring after randomization.

The YO program offered educational, employment, leadership enhancement, and other support services to all youth ages 14 to 21 in targeted high-poverty areas across the country in order to boost their high school graduation, college enrollment, and employment rates.
The study assessed program implementation and examined strengths and weaknesses of the YO model by gathering information on services provided, program outcomes, and implementation challenges and best practices at 25 sites. It drew on management information systems (MIS) data; group interviews with program administrators, line staff, and youth participants; and past process evaluation reports.
Projects were successful in enrolling a large number of participants and nearly 40 percent of those enrolled received a long-term placement. Projects eventually succeeded in establishing YO centers but faced challenges in launching and running the centers, delivering comprehensive and integrated youth development services, sustaining long-term youth engagement, and developing partnerships for sustainability.","","In 2000, the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) awarded YO grants to 36 sites in urban, rural, and Native American locations in 30 states, and over the course of their five-year period served 67,710 youth. The YO model had five key features: (1) geographic saturation, or the eligibility of all youth ages 14 to 21 in targeted high-poverty areas to participate in the program; (2) the establishment of YO community centers, where youth would be able to gather, socialize, and engage in program activities in a safe and welcoming environment; (3) the linkage of leadership opportunities, support services, and educational and career-related programming under a youth development framework; (4) long-term engagement of youth after their completion of program activities; and (5) partnerships with external organizations to ensure program continuity beyond the project period. ETA selected 15 types of youth development services to offer to youth, but allowed sites to combine and emphasize strategies as needed to develop intervention packages best suited to their participant pool and local context.","This study assessed program implementation and strengths and weaknesses of the five elements of the YO model. It examined the services provided in the final phase of program implementation, described how services changed over time, and compared service strategies and outcomes for in-school youth (ISY) versus out-of-school youth (OSY). It discussed key human capital and social outcomes, analyzed how they varied across ISY and OSY, and identified factors associated with positive outcomes by comparing the three best-performing sites with the four lowest-ranking sites. The study conducted a combined analysis of information from three data sources: (1) MIS data from all five years of the program; (2) previous process evaluation reports; and (3) group interviews conducted in months 3 through 8 of program year 5 (2005) with program administrators, line staff, and youth participants at 25 of the 30 rural and urban sites (the 6 Native American sites were not included in the study). The study was part of a broader evaluation of the program, which included an ethnographic study, an analysis of MIS data, and a youth survey to assess changes in labor market outcomes.","Most sites were able to establish one or more YO centers and were successful in creating safe and comfortable spaces that youth found appealing. Project staff did find it challenging to set up and run these centers due to the size of the grant, the large number of partners, the short start-up period, and constraints in management capacity and continuity. Despite these difficulties, the YO program succeeded in reaching large numbers of eligible students and saturating its targeted low-income areas; 14 of the 25 projects studied met enrollment targets.
Sites faced difficulties designing and delivering comprehensive and integrated youth development services. They focused instead on high school graduation (especially for ISY) and long-term employment (especially for OSY). Sites emphasized provision of job readiness training, internships, short-term occupational skills training, short-term unsubsidized jobs, and generalized education diploma (GED) preparation. Program strategies varied for ISY and OSY.
The projects were successful in ensuring their participants achieved important educational and employment goals, with 44 percent of OSY and 36 percent of ISY receiving long-term placements. OSY were more likely to receive job placements, whereas ISY were more likely to opt for college entry. Take-up rates among those placed were 61 percent for OSY and 46 percent for ISY. Enrollment rates among those placed in college were 26 percent for OSY and 54 percent for ISY.
The study found that some, but not all, elements of the YO model had been successfully implemented; not many projects were able to successfully engage participating youth in the long term or conceptualize and implement the more holistic approach to youth development put forward by the YO model, which sought to improve not only academic and employment outcomes, but also leadership capacity and social skills. Only a few projects were able to leverage partnerships successfully to increase the sustainability of the YO program. Only 9 of 25 were able to retain some YO programming upon grant completion, and only 2 anticipated being able to continue providing the comprehensive set of YO services.","This was a well-executed study of the YO program, which set out and answered its research questions systematically. It relied on a variety of data sources, validated data using on-site member checks and regular triangulation across sources, and took steps to increase study objectivity by conducting consistency checks across field reports and using a coding scheme to analyze site visit data. The findings provided a helpful summary of the program’s core activities and offered insights into the factors influencing key outcomes. The report’s lessons learned chapter is particularly rich, describing at length the solutions proposed by respondents to key implementation challenges.","",""

The Riverside Phase 2 site was one of two in Riverside, California, that participated in the Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) project.
The authors randomly assigned 2,907 employed single-parent participants in Riverside’s Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program to one of two treatment groups that received differing ERA services or to a control group that received standard TANF services. The authors analyzed data from Unemployment Insurance (UI), TANF, and Food Stamps administrative records and a survey administered 12 months after random assignment.
The study found that the households of participants in the Work Plus program were 10.5 percentage points less likely to receive TANF benefits relative to those in the control group 12 months after random assignment. The study found no statistically significant effects associated with the Training Focused program.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is high because it was based on a well-conducted randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Riverside Work Plus program and not to other factors. It also means that we would be confident that any estimated effects would be attributable to Riverside Training Focused program and not to other factors. However, the study did not find statistically significant effects of the Training Focused program.","","The ERA project was introduced in 1999 as a nationwide exploration of factors that help welfare recipients not only find employment but retain their positions and advance in their careers. Riverside included 3 of 16 ERA interventions or sites across the United States to receive funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to implement a program intended to improve welfare recipients’ employment outcomes. This profile summarizes 2 of those Riverside interventions. (The authors reported results for a third intervention in Riverside separately, so CLEAR also reviewed the results separately.)
TANF recipients assigned to the Riverside Work Plus and the Training Focused programs could receive intensive case management and enhanced support services, both aimed at encouraging employment stability. Work Plus clients were encouraged to attend education and training (including vocational training) activities after working at least 20 hours per week. The reasoning behind this was that working reinforced the value of education and training and that working while in school or training would increase the likelihood of program completion and the use of newly attained skills. Training Focused clients were encouraged to attend education and training activities and they could (with case manager approval) decrease or eliminate their work hours as long as they participated in education and training activities. Clients in both programs also received supportive services (such as child care, transportation, and payments to participate in program activities); social services (such as mental health, domestic violence, and substance abuse services); public assistance programs; and job-search services.","From January 2001 to October 2003, 2,907 employed, single-parent TANF recipients were assigned to one of the two programs or a control group that could participate in the Work Focused program. Clients in this condition were eligible to receive TANF benefits, Food Stamps, child care and transportation assistance, and medical coverage. They also received limited and reactive case management.
The authors estimated employment and earnings impacts by comparing regression-adjusted UI wage records of treatment and control group members over the first two years following random assignment. The authors also calculated program impacts for benefit receipt measures, including whether participants received TANF or Food Stamps, through two years after random assignment using TANF and Food Stamps administrative records. Finally, the authors estimated additional employment, earnings, and public assistance outcomes from a survey administered 12 months after random assignment.","The study found that participants in the Work Plus program were 10.5 percentage points less likely to receive TANF benefits 12 months after random assignment, relative to those in the control group. This result was statistically significant.
The study found no statistically significant effects associated with the Training Focused program.","The authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to employment, earnings, and benefit receipt. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","",""

Incentives were in the form of cash or a voucher for cash that participants could immediately redeem at the hospital cashier.
Employment incentives were offered in two phases: During Phase I (the first 16 weeks), incentives were offered for completing work-related activities, such as searching or applying for jobs. Veterans were rewarded if they had completed various work-related activities for which they could earn up to $610. Offered for the first 32 weeks, Phase II aimed to incentivize obtaining and maintaining employment. For the entire 36-week course of the intervention, veterans could earn up to $1,170.
Veterans could also receive incentives for abstaining from substance use. Treatment group participants were screened for drug and alcohol use twice a week over a 16-week period and received $2.50 for an initial clean drug and alcohol screening. The value of each consecutive negative screen increased by $1, totaling $560 if all 32 samples tested clean. Treatment group participants with positive screens received no payment, and any future possible incentives were reset to the original $2.50 level. Control group participants received $5 per biweekly screen for a total of $160 over 16 weeks, regardless of test results.
The program was implemented at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Bedford, Massachusetts, in 2007. To be eligible for the program, veterans had to meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, criteria for dual diagnosis of a psychiatric (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, or other anxiety disorder) and substance abuse disorder for alcohol, cocaine, or opiates. Other requirements for participants included having the potential for returning to competitive supported employment within 6 months, not having had any suicidal or homicidal ideations within the past 12 weeks, remaining abstinent from drugs and alcohol for at least 1 week, being age 55 or younger, having no medical problems that would hinder their ability to obtain competitive employment, participating in vocational rehabilitation (VR) services within the Compensated Work Therapy (CWT) program for at least 4 months, living within the local region for 12 months, having at least 10 years of formal education, and having no history of significant head trauma or other disorder causing significant cognitive impairment. The majority of the sample members were white, middle-aged men with more than 12 years of education. Most had affective or anxiety disorders, and all met the criteria for dependence on either alcohol, cocaine, or opiates.","The authors conducted a randomized controlled trial, analyzing data on a total of 100 veterans. Some veterans were assigned to receive the CM intervention (the treatment group) in addition to traditional VR services, and other veterans were assigned to receive only traditional VR services.
Veterans receiving VR services (both the treatment and control groups) were placed in structured work settings and were compensated with an average of $7.28 per hour. While working, staff helped veterans resolve on-the-job difficulties and prepared them to obtain their own competitive job. Staff also encouraged veterans to perform job-search tasks, abstain from drugs and alcohol, and seek competitive employment.
The authors used a baseline evaluation to collect baseline data. To assess the intervention’s impacts on employment and health outcomes, the authors used the Job Search Behaviors Index, along with drug and alcohol screenings. Data were collected regularly for the first 16 weeks after participants were randomly assigned to a study group, with follow-up data collection occurring at 3, 6, and 9 months. To encourage data collection, the control group veterans received $5 per biweekly screening over 16 weeks, regardless of the test results, for a total of $160. Control group participants received an additional $30 incentive for completing their final interview, compared to treatment group participants.","Employment
At nine months, 50 percent of treatment group participants had obtained competitive employment compared to only 28 percent of control group participants.
Participants in the treatment group completed 39 percent more job-search tasks than control group participants.
At the end of the 16-week period, 86 percent of treatment group participants had completed their resumes compared to 68 percent of control group participants.
Seventy-eight percent of the treatment group had submitted at least one job application by week 16 compared to 50 percent of the control group.
Health
Treatment group participants remained abstinent from drugs and alcohol longer than control group participants (11.8 weeks versus 9.4 weeks).
Treatment group participants were less likely to relapse by week 16 (50 percent versus 72 percent), but in the full nine-month follow-up period, the difference between the groups was no longer statistically significant.","","",""

The study was a randomized controlled trial. The authors used administrative data from the program and state data systems to compare the outcomes of former prisoners who had been randomly assigned to the NWP with those of former prisoners who were randomly assigned to a control group that received basic employment services.
The study found that those assigned to the NWP were more likely than the control group to be employed in all four quarters during the year after the program and were more likely to be employed in the program’s worksite project in the fourth quarter after the program.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the CEO NWP’s transitional job services and not to other factors.","","The NWP was a comprehensive employment program for former prisoners offered by the CEO in New York City. In an effort to reduce recidivism and improve labor market prospects, the program provided former prisoners with temporary, paid jobs and other employment services, such as a four-day life skills class, job coaching, job development, parenting classes, and post-placement services.","The study was a randomized controlled trial. To be eligible for the study, former prisoners needed a referral to CEO by their parole officer, had to report to the program, could not have worked in a CEO transitional job in the year before baseline, did not participate in New York State’s Shock Incarceration (or other small special programs), and had signed an informed consent form. Eligible study participants were randomly assigned to either the NWP group or to a control group. The control group had access to a 1.5-day version of the life skills class; a resource room containing computers with job-search software along with telephones, printers, and fax machines; and staff assistance for help with various aspects of searching for jobs. The authors estimated the impacts of NWP by comparing the mean outcomes of the two study groups, accounting for demographic characteristics.","The study found no statistically significant differences between the groups in employment in the fourth quarter after random assignment.
However, 21.7 percent of the former prisoners in the NWP program were employed for all four quarters in the year following the program, compared with 10.9 percent of control group members; this difference was statistically significant.","One of the features of the NWP was a temporary job. The authors reported that some 72 percent of NWP group members worked at a NWP worksite, many for several weeks. Thus, an interpretation of the finding for consecutive quarters of employment must bear in mind that some of the employment experiences captured were in transitional jobs, and not permanent jobs.","",""

The author used data from an annual Indonesian national survey to estimate an instrumental variable (IV) regression model to examine if scholarship receipt affected school enrollment, and probit models to examine the effects on child labor and school attendance.
The study found that the receipt of a scholarship was significantly associated with a decrease in child labor and an increase in school attendance.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the author did not ensure that the groups being compared were similar before receiving the JPS in the probit model and no evidence was provided on the strength of the instrument used in the IV model. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Jaring Pengaman Sosial (JPS) scholarship program; other factors are likely to have contributed.","Absence of Conflict of Interest.","The Jaring Prengaman Sosial (JPS) scholarship started in the 1998-1999 academic year. Scholarships were targeted to children from poor households in grade 4 or higher. The scholarship amount increased with grade level: 10,000 rupiahs per month for enrollment in primary school; 20,000 rupiahs per month for enrollment in junior secondary school; and 25,000 rupiahs per month for enrollment in senior secondary school. The scholarship funds were distributed in three phases. During the first phase, the funds were distributed to districts based on poverty estimations from the 1996 Indonesian national economic survey (Susenas). During the second phase, district committees determined which schools would receive the funding based the economic conditions of the community that the school served. During the third and final phase, school committees assigned scholarships to children based on prosperity status, household composition (with preference given to single-parent and large households), and distance to school. The school committees were instructed to award at least half of the scholarships to girls.","The study used a nonexperimental design to compare the treatment group receiving the Jaring Prengaman Sosial (JPS) scholarship in 1999 to the comparison group that did not receive the JPS. The author used data from Indonesia’s 1998 and 1999 national economic survey, Susenas, for a sample of 113,187 children (ages 10 to 18). Using these data, the author estimated bivariate probit and IV regression models to analyze the relationship between JPS and both child labor and school enrollment. The JPS scholarships were implemented using decentralized targeting, which resulted in delivery of the program in some areas that should not have been targeted. The author capitalized on the mistargeting and used geographic separability (at the district level) to select the instrument for the instrumental variable analysis. The instrument chosen to identify the scholarships effect on outcomes was constructed from the actual poverty profile for the district in 1998 and the mistargeting due to selection rules (1996 poverty estimate and number of enrolled students in the district). In the probit models, the author controlled for age, household size, agricultural or non-agricultural income, head of household demographics, and schooling type (public or private).","Employment/Child labor
The receipt of a JPS scholarship was significantly associated with a decrease in the probability of child labor by 3.8 percentage points.
Education (School participation/enrollment)
The receipt of a JPS scholarship was significantly associated with an increase in the probability of school attendance in the previous week by 1.5 percentage points.
However, the receipt of a JPS scholarship was not significantly associated with school enrollment.","The author did not include a test of the instrument’s strength in his analysis of the IV model. Also, the author did not account for preexisting differences between the groups before program participation including baseline school attendance and child labor outcomes in the probit models.

The authors used a nonexperimental study design to examine the earnings and employment outcomes of women who took part in JSS. Women were categorized as being in the treatment group if they participated in JSS at least once from the second quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 2000. Women who did not participate in JSS during this time made up the comparison group.
The study found that the first instance of participation in JSS increased the likelihood of employment by 4 percent for women seeking employment. The study also found a positive and statistically significant relationship between quarterly earnings and participation in JSS one or more times for employed women.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not ensure that the groups compared exhibited similar employment or earnings outcomes before the intervention. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to JSS; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","JSS is a job search assistance service of WorkFirst, a welfare reform program, in Washington State. The JSS program assists people for up to 12 weeks with finding employment. Participants could receive one or more of the following program components: classroom instruction; job search support services with a specialist or group of unemployed peers; or pre-employment, high-wage, or high-demand trainings. The authors did not describe the pre-employment, high-wage, and high-demand trainings. Though JSS is mandatory on first entry into WorkFirst, people are not required to participate in JSS if they find more than 20 hours of unsubsidized employment, have a child younger than three months old, provide an accepted excuse, need additional skills or experience as determined by a specialist, or require other support services because of substance abuse or domestic violence. If participants remain unemployed after completing JSS for the first time, they may choose to participate in the program again.","The study included 13,626 women who entered and exited WorkFirst from the second quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 2000. The study participants were ages 25 to 35 and were receiving welfare. Among the unemployed women, 21 percent were married, 70 percent were white, 10 percent were Hispanic, and 14 percent had completed high school. The unemployed women in the sample had, on average, 2.4 children and had been receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families for an average of 23 quarters. Among the employed participants, 14 percent were married, 63 percent were white, 14 percent were Hispanic, and 15 percent had completed high school. The employed women had on average 2.4 children and had been receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families for an average of 24 quarters.
The authors compared employment and earnings outcomes of women who participated in JSS zero times, one time, or more than one time. Of the 13,626 women in the study, 4,791 women did not participate in JSS, 5,100 women participated once, and 3,735 women participated more than once. The authors analyzed the effect of participating in JSS one or more times relative to what an individual would have experienced without participating in JSS using an econometric technique that can examine employment and earnings measures collected over time (a Type II Tobit model). The authors did not specify the source of the data used in the study.","The study found that the first instance of participation in JSS significantly increased the likelihood of employment by 4 percent for women seeking employment. Subsequent JSS participation had no additional significant impacts on employment.
The study also found a positive and statistically significant relationship between quarterly earnings and participation in one or more JSS for employed women. The impact of JSS increased quarterly earnings by, on average, 40 percent for participation in the first JSS and by 31 percent, on average, in quarterly earnings for the second and third JSS.","The main empirical approach employed by the authors compared the outcomes of participants who participated in JSS one or more times, thereby examining differences for individuals over-time as well as differences across individuals at any given time. The study identified the effect of an individual’s participation in JSS (1, 2, or 3 or more times) relative to the outcomes an individual would have experienced without participating in JSS. However, the statistical analysis did not account for employment or earnings more than one year prior to joining the Workfirst program. Consequently, even accounting for study members’ characteristics, participation in JSS, and current employment and earnings, may still be strongly influenced by past employment and earnings.","",""

The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to JTPA, and not to other factors.","","JTPA was created to improve the labor outcomes of youth and disadvantaged adults. This study explored the impact of three “treatment streams” under the JTPA: (1) free classroom training in occupational skills; (2) subsidized on-the-job training with private employers; and (3) a residual “other” category that includes those referred to job search assistance, adult basic education, subsidized work experience with public or not-for-profit employers, or other JTPA assistance not including classroom occupational skills or on-the-job training (unless both were recommended). Individuals were eligible to participate in JTPA if they fell below an income threshold or if they received food stamps, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.","The study included 14,911 individuals over the age of 21 who applied for JTPA assistance at one of the 16 participating locations across the United States from November 1987 to September 1989, were deemed eligible to participate, and were recommended to receive at least one JTPA service. Study participants were placed into one of three treatment streams based on caseworkers’ recommendations and then randomly assigned to treatment in that stream or to a control condition with no access to JTPA resources for 18 months. The authors used surveys administered at baseline, at 18 months after assignment, and at 30 months after assignment to compare earnings and employment outcomes of each of the treatment arms, as well as all treatment groups combined, to the earnings and employment outcomes of control group members. The 30-month surveys were supplemented with administrative earnings and employment records in 12 of the 16 sites.","Employment. The study found that women who were randomly assigned to any JTPA treatment arm were 3 to 4 percentage points more likely to be employed 18 and 30 months after program enrollment than women in the control group.

Earnings. Men and women randomly assigned to receive any JTPA service earned approximately $1,200 more in the first 30 months after program enrollment than those in the control group.

Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated. This review limited the number of comparisons presented by examining only those outcomes for which the authors found statistically significant differences in the impacts across the JTPA treatment arms.
In addition, not all treatment group members enrolled in JTPA, so this analysis examines access to—not receipt of—JTPA services. Just over half of study participants (56 percent of men and 54 percent of women) who were assigned to any JTPA service actually received JTPA services","",""

Companion reports describe the initiative’s implementation.
The initiative’s effectiveness was evaluated using two separate comparison group designs.
In general, the study found positive and statistically significant relationships between the YO initiative and educational enrollment outcomes. However, there were few statistically significant effects on employment-related outcomes and educational attainment.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this study is low. This means we are not confident that the estimated impacts were caused by the YO Grant Initiative, and not other factors.","","The YO Grant Initiative operated from 2000 until 2005. Thirty-six communities (24 urban, 6 rural, 6 Native American) provided comprehensive services to more than 92,000 economically disadvantaged youth, ages 14 to 21. Services were available regardless of income, but the program’s goal was to target youth programming in areas with high levels of joblessness and poverty, especially among out-of-school youth, and to serve as a foundation for community-wide efforts to mobilize resources for supporting youth to enter the economic mainstream.
The 36 grantees, selected by a competitive application process, provided services to both in-school and out-of-school youth in the community. The program’s core activities included job readiness training, internships or subsidized employment, short-term occupational skills training, short-term unsubsidized jobs, and GED preparation. Most youth participated in at least one core service as well as other services designed to support them, such as sports and recreation. On average, participants spent 563 hours participating in program activities at the study sites.","The study used two different nonexperimental designs to examine the effectiveness of YO. The first design was a census tract-level analysis using data from the American Community Survey (ACS) to form a comparison group. The second design was an individual-level analysis using data drawn from the Current Population Survey (CPS).
For the analysis using the ACS data, the authors first grouped 29 non-Native American YO sites and comparison census tracts into bins based on their similarity in terms of their population, percentage of home ownership, median contract rent, percentage of vacant housing units, percentage of whites in the population, percentage of rural population, and labor force participation rate. The authors then estimated YO’s impact by comparing the changes in employment and education outcomes from baseline (2001) to follow-up (2003–2004) for the YO and comparison communities within each bin. These were combined across bins to calculate an overall estimate.
For the analysis using the CPS data, the YO group consisted of all youth ages 16 to 21 who lived in the target areas of 23 of the 24 urban YO sites, because they were all eligible to participate in YO. The comparison group consisted of similarly aged youth in high-poverty (defined as poverty above 20 percent according to the 1990 Census) central-city neighborhoods. The authors estimated YO’s impact by comparing the changes in employment and education outcomes between April 2000 and March 2004 for youth in the YO and comparison communities.","The study examined 11 employment-related outcomes across the two designs. Of these, the study found a statistically significant positive relationship between living in a YO target area and the labor force participation rate and percentage of those employed working full time in the CPS analysis. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups on the other 9 employment-related outcomes examined across the two studies.
The study examined 5 educational attainment outcomes in the ACS analysis. Of these, the study found a statistically significant positive relationship between participation in the YO program and having completed 11th grade.
The authors examined 8 educational enrollment outcomes across the two designs. The authors found that participation in YO was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the percentage of youth not in school and an increase in the percentage of youth in secondary school (ACS analysis). They also found that living in a YO target area was associated with a statistically significant reduction in high school dropout spells (CPS analysis).
The authors also examined program impacts by gender, race/ethnicity, and nativity. Of note, the study found statistically significant increases in the labor force participation rates and mean hourly wages of women associated with living in a YO target area.","Although the ACS analysis attempted to match YO communities to other similar communities, differences in labor force participation rates remained and were not controlled for in the analysis. This could have been mitigated if there were similar trends in those rates before the study period, but this was not demonstrated. Also, although participants spent an average of more than 500 hours participating in YO programs, the total time spent varied widely among grantees and among individuals within grantees.
Similarly, the high-poverty communities selected to be part of the CPS analysis had very different racial compositions from the YO target areas. In addition, for this analysis there was no indication that YO target areas and comparison areas had similar levels or trends in employment and education-related outcomes at the start of the study period. These factors indicate that the comparison group does not provide a valid representation of what would have happened to the YO group in the absence of YO. Finally, the effects of YO may be diluted because youth who did not participate in YO but lived in YO treatment areas were included in the treatment group.","Albany, GA*

The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is low. This low rating means that we are not confident that an increase in the number of funds offered within a class causes the increase in the share of funds allocated to assets in that class. We can only say that the two variables of interest are positively correlated.","","","","The share of funds allocated to assets within a particular class increased as the number of fund options within that class increased. For example, a 10 percentage point increase in the share of funds classified as domestic equity funds is associated with a 4.5 percentage point increase in the share of funds allocated to domestic equities.
The results suggest that people use heuristic rules, such as the 1/n rule, to make asset-allocation decisions.","By controlling for firm fixed effects and other variables, the authors accounted for the employee and firm characteristics required for studies reviewed in this area. There is some concern that changes in the composition of funds offered by a 401(k) reflect changes in employee demand or other trends in investment. If this occurred, increases in demand for investment options in a certain equity class might lead to increases in both number of funds offered in that class and share of all investments in funds within that class, leading to the observed positive relationship; however, the authors used robustness analyses to address this concern. Based on these analyses, there is little reason to believe that changes in the types of funds offered over time by a 401(k) plan reflect the preferences of employees for different types of funds.
Despite this, changes in firm composition may be correlated with changes in 401(k) plan characteristics. As this study used data at the firm level, it must demonstrate the composition of employees and/or 401(k) participants within firms remained constant over time. No evidence is provided on changes in the composition of firms or investors.","",""

Supported employment interventions use a combination of employment and health services and supports to improve employment and other outcomes.
This study aggregated data from randomized controlled trials in four sites: New Hampshire, Connecticut, Illinois, and Washington, D.C. Study data sources included baseline interviews and 18-month follow-up data from each site.
The study found that, across all recipient types, the programs increased the probability of employment, the number of weeks worked, and the number of weeks worked at a single job by a statistically significant margin.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is low. This means that we cannot be confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the support employment interventions; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Supported employment programs use a combination of employment and health services and supports to improve employment and other outcomes for people with psychiatric conditions. The supported employment interventions examined in this study—referred to as individual placement and support (IPS) programs—aimed to address the many barriers those ages 18 to 64 with psychiatric disabilities face when seeking employment. The services provided varied by site, but typical IPS programs combine mental health services, vocational services, benefits counseling, client input regarding preferred positions, expedited job search, and ongoing personal support.","This study relied on findings from randomized controlled trials conducted in New Hampshire, Connecticut, Illinois, and Washington, D.C., during the 1990s and early 2000s. Each trial site assigned adults with psychiatric disabilities who had volunteered to participate to either the treatment group, which received IPS services, or the control group, which received existing vocational services. The researchers collected data from baseline interviews and 18-month follow-up surveys.
The authors used generalized linear models to estimate impacts of supported employment programs relative to the control condition among four mutually exclusive recipient statuses—SSDI-only recipients, SSI-only recipients, concurrent SSDI/SSI recipients, and nonrecipients. The authors examined impacts by programmatic group because SSDI and SSI program rules create different, potentially overlapping work incentives for their recipients.","The study found that, for all four recipient statuses examined, treatment group members were significantly more likely than control group members to be employed and worked considerably more weeks over the 18-month follow-up period.


In addition to working more overall, treatment group members tallied significantly more weeks worked at a single job.","Although the analyses in this report were conducted by recipient status, the number of study participants randomly assigned to the treatment and control groups within each recipient status type was unknown. Therefore, attrition could not be computed and the study was not eligible to receive a high causal evidence rating. Moreover, the analysis did not include controls for a number of baseline variables required to demonstrate that the two groups being analyzed were similar before the intervention, making it ineligible for a moderate causal evidence rating.
In addition, the authors cautioned that the SSDI and SSI subsamples might not be representative of SSDI and SSI recipients more broadly or SSDI and SSI recipients with psychiatric conditions.","Connecticut

Program activities included receiving a handheld computer and an invitation to participate in meetings to share experiences using the computer and suggestions for improving the user’s experience.
The study used a comparison group design to compare outcomes for the treatment group with those of women who enrolled in engineering in adjacent years. Data sources included an attitudinal survey administered for the first analysis and administrative records to measure students’ graduation rates for the second analysis.
In the first analysis, the study found no significant differences in attitudes toward engineering between the treatment and comparison groups. For the second analysis, though results were not presented and methods were not described, the authors reported that they uncovered significant differences in persistence between the treatment and comparison groups. They noted that program participants were significantly more likely to graduate in engineering than both (1) women from the same year who did not participate in the program and (2) women who enrolled in engineering in adjacent years.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because it does not include control variables to adjust for differences between treatment and comparison groups. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the intervention; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The study took place at Santa Clara University and included all female freshman and sophomore students enrolled in engineering in fall 1999 who agreed to participate in the Jornada Intervention (65 percent of those asked). Students in the intervention or treatment group received a handheld computer called the Hewlett-Packard Jornada, either as a personal digital assistant device or a 3/4-sized laptop computer, and were invited to attend regular meetings with other treatment students to evaluate the computer and discuss how to improve its functioning. Participants also completed a workshop that focused on improving future generations of cell phone technology. The purpose of the intervention was to (1) “increas[e] their self-identification as ‘techies’” and (2) form a group of female students who would meet to discuss technology and technological issues.","The study included 54 participants in the treatment group and 17 students in the comparison group, comprising a single cohort, for the first analysis. Sample sizes were not provided for the second analysis, which included six comparison years.
For the first analysis, the authors administered a study-designed survey two years following implementation of the intervention using a scale constructed from attitudinal measures in the “Success in Engineering” instrument. Survey results were compared for the treatment and comparison groups and analyzed with a paired-samples t-test.
For the second analysis, the authors compared graduation rates for female students who entered the university during the year the intervention was implemented with those who enrolled in adjacent years, though they did not describe their methods for this analysis.","The first analysis found no significant differences between the two-year follow-up attitudinal measures of the treatment and comparison groups.
In the second analysis, the six-year graduation rate of the treatment group was 75.9 percent, compared with the 52.9 percent rate of the comparison group. The authors reported that these results were significant, though results were not presented and methods were not described.","There are several factors to consider when interpreting this study. The study used a quasi-experimental approach to evaluating the intervention; however no control variables were used to adjust for differences between groups. Further, the composition of the two groups included some systematic variation: the treatment group contained freshmen and sophomores, whereas the control group contained only freshmen. Sophomores had already persisted from the first to the second year of college, making them perhaps more likely to graduate and have positive attitudes toward engineering.
Further, selection bias likely influenced the study outcomes, as students opted in to the intervention. Expressing interest in attending group meetings to discuss technology (one component of the intervention) is likely correlated with an outcome of interest—holding positive attitudes toward engineering. Selection into the study might also be correlated with a number of other factors, including motivation, work and family obligations, and collaborative working style, that are in turn correlated with persistence outcomes.","",""

The study was a randomized controlled trial that used data from administrative records for the two years following assignment and a survey conducted with a random subset of the sample to assess outcomes one year after assignment.
The study found that treatment group participants were significantly more likely than control group participants to have had a job and had higher average earnings. The treatment group was significantly less likely to receive cash assistance and received lower amounts of cash assistance benefits than the control group.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to PRIDE and not to other factors.","","PRIDE was a welfare-to-work program in New York City that operated from 1999 to 2004. The program had two elements: work-based education and vocational rehabilitation. Recipients were required to participate in unpaid work placements designed to accommodate their health conditions and received job search, placement, and retention services. Clients who did not participate could face a reduction in their welfare benefits or have their welfare cases closed. The work-based education component included education and training programs.","The study was a randomized controlled trial that screened participants for eligibility before randomly assigning people to either a treatment or control group. Study participants received either Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or Safety Net (a locally and state-funded welfare program) benefits and had physical or mental health problems that limited their ability to work. The study focused on the 2,648 single parents in the sample, with 1,553 in the treatment group and 1,095 in the control group. Analyses of survey data focused on the 759 randomly selected subsample members who completed a survey, with 380 in the treatment group and 379 in the control group.
The authors compared outcomes for the treatment versus control groups by examining means for each group, after adjusting for pretreatment characteristics.","The study found that treatment group participants were significantly more likely than control group members to be employed during the first year (23 versus 19 percent). Treatment group members were also more likely to be employed during the ninth quarter after random assignment (20 versus 16 percent), which researchers counted as the end of the second year.
The treatment group had significantly higher weekly earnings than the control group did at the time of the 12-month survey ($73 versus $55).
The treatment group received significantly less cash assistance at year 1 ($5,806 versus $6,100) and at year 2 ($4,925 and $5,450) than the control group did, and a smaller percentage had ever received cash assistance by year 2 (88 versus 91 percent).","Only about half of those assigned to the treatment group actually received PRIDE services. Those who did not receive services were determined to be either fully or not at all employable, or were sanctioned for not complying with New York City’s Human Resources Administration work requirements.
In addition, the study authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to employment, earnings, and public benefits receipt. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","",""

The study found that RSP group members had significantly fewer official and criminal contacts than the comparison group one year after release from out-of-home placement.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the program was implemented in only one county and there was no variation in the implementation of the program over time. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the RSP; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The RSP served youthful offenders in their reentry into the community from out-of-home placement in Clay County, Minnesota. The program was designed to begin 30 days before release from out-of-home placement and continue for six months following release to the community. Through two transitional coordinators working with probation officers, the RSP sought to reduce the likelihood of further crime and delinquency by providing comprehensive reentry case management and connecting youth to employment, stable housing, substance abuse treatment, physical and mental health care, and community-based services and supports.","The analysis included 92 RSP youth whose files were closed as of April 2007, and 92 youth in a comparison group from a nearby county (Becker County, Minnesota) that offered standard probation services to youth exiting out-of-home placement, but no additional reentry services. The target population was youth ages 11 to 19 returning from out-of-home placement of three or more weeks. The authors estimated regression models comparing the number of criminal and official contacts with police or the courts at 6, 12, and 24 months after reentry, pulled from an electronic Court Services Tracking System, between RSP and comparison group members. The authors controlled for differences in demographics and number of prior charges.","The study found statistically significant reductions in the number of official contacts and the number of criminal contacts for the RSP group one year after release from out-of-home placement.","Because the analysis considered a program operating in only one county, it is impossible to disentangle the effect of the RSP from the effect of the county itself; this is known as a confounding factor. For instance, there could have been other changes to the criminal justice system occurring at the county level at the same time that could also have affected the outcomes of interest. Therefore, we cannot attribute the estimated effects with confidence to the RSP, and not other factors, and the study is not eligible for a moderate causal evidence rating. If the study had included more than one county and/or the authors had compared the changes in the outcomes over time across the treatment and comparison counties, it could be eligible for a moderate evidence rating.
In addition, there were large differences between the RSP and comparison groups in prior criminal justice activity. The comparison group had more prior contacts, prior charges, felony charges, number of days in placement, and total days in placement relative to the RSP group. Even though the analysis included statistical controls for these measures, these controls might not be able to fully account for existing differences of this magnitude. Varying levels of prior criminal justice activity, rather than the intervention, could explain any observed differences in outcomes between the groups.","",""

This means we are confident that any estimated effects are attributable to Minnesota’s Tier 2 program and not to other factors.","","The ERA project was introduced in 1999 as a nationwide exploration of factors that help welfare recipients not only find employment but retain their positions and advance in their careers. Minnesota was one of 16 sites across the United States to receive funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to implement a program intended to improve welfare recipients’ employment outcomes.
People assigned to Tier 2 worked with case managers whose caseloads had been reduced to 25 to 30 cases. Participation in Tier 2 was mandatory and could be enforced by sanctioning TANF benefits. Case managers performed detailed assessments of clients to identify the underlying challenges affecting them and their families and then referred clients to services that addressed those challenges. Clients had access to education or job training programs but were required to work 20 hours per week concurrently with participation in such programs. Clients searched for jobs for up to six weeks; those still unemployed at the end of that period were placed in either unpaid employment or supported employment in which their paid employment was paired with job coaching or on-the-job training.","The program was built on the services provided by Tier 1, the existing welfare-to-work program. TANF recipients who had been assigned to a Tier 1 employment services provider for at least 12 months, had not worked in the previous 3 months, were unemployed at the time of random assignment, were not participating in an education or training program, and were not under sanction were eligible for assignment to Tier 2. Eligible Tier 1 recipients were randomly assigned from January 2002 to April 2003 to enroll in Tier 2 or remain in Tier 1; half were randomly assigned to each condition.
The vast majority of participants were female (93.2 percent) and most were African American (67.8 percent). Nearly 70 percent had received public assistance benefits for more than two years and about one-third described themselves as suffering from health problems.

The study found that Camp Reach attendees were significantly more likely to have taken computer science and other science or engineering courses in high school than those who did not attend.

However, SOCP youth indicated they used ecstasy/MDMA less frequently than control youth in the past 30 days (1.8 versus 4.2 days).","Outcome data were based on self-reported delinquent behavior and drug use, which are less reliable than administrative records. In particular, youth in the SOCP group might have exaggerated or minimized their self-reported behaviors to please the evaluation team member who interviewed them.
The authors examined differences between SOCP and control youth across 18 types of crimes and 13 types of drugs. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","",""

The authors analyzed the outcomes of a nationwide sample of 4.7 million SSI and SSDI recipients ages 18 to 57 who would have been eligible for TTW in 2001. The authors used administrative records through 2004 from the Social Security Administration (SSA) and Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA).
The study found that enrollment in employment services increased 0.1 to 0.4 percent in states where TTW was in effect. However, the authors found no evidence of increased earnings as a result of TTW.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this study is moderate, the highest possible rating for nonexperimental designs. This means we have some confidence that the observed effects represent the impact of TTW, although other factors might also have contributed.","Absence of conflict of interest: This study was conducted by staff from Mathematica Policy Research, which administers CLEAR. Therefore, the review of this study was conducted by an independent consultant trained in applying the CLEAR causal evidence guidelines.","The TTW program aimed to improve employment outcomes for people with disabilities by providing SSI and SSDI recipients with an enhanced menu of employment services. Recipients older than 18 received a ticket by mail entitling them to free employment services through local employment networks (ENs) or state vocational rehabilitation agencies (SVRAs), organizations that offer job search assistance, career counseling, and other employment services. Using the ticket was voluntary. To encourage service receipt and, ultimately, gainful employment, SSA offered ENs and SVRAs reimbursement incentives tied to the progress their ticket holders made toward employment. TTW went into effect in different states at different times. Tickets were mailed in Phase I states in 2002, in Phase II states in 2003, and in Phase III states in 2004.","The authors used the staggered implementation of the mailing of tickets in Phases I through III to create comparison groups. In each year, the authors treated the eligible recipients living in states where the program was in effect as the treatment group and eligible recipients in states where the program had not yet been implemented as the comparison group. For example, in 2002, when tickets had been mailed only in Phase I states, eligible recipients in Phase I states comprised the treatment group and eligible recipients in Phase II and Phase III states were the comparison group.
The study analyzed administrative records from SSA and RSA through 2004. Outcomes of interest included service enrollment, earnings, and benefit amount. The authors controlled for possible differences among the treatment and comparison groups by stratifying the sample by age range (18 to 39, 40 to 49, and 50 to 57) and disability type (SSI only, SSDI only, dually eligible) and including individual and regional fixed effects in their models.","The study found that employment service enrollment for recipients increased from 0.1 to 0.4 percent in Phase I states after program implementation.
However, the authors found no evidence of differences in earnings between treatment and comparison groups over the study period.","TTW was rolled out beginning in 2002 and this article examined impacts through 2004. It is possible that this follow-up period was too short to expect to see impacts on earnings, particularly given the small increase in service receipt after program implementation. In addition, the TTW implementation coincided with a change in SVRA record-keeping practices that could have inflated the service receipt data.","",""

Affirmative action and the case of California’s Proposition 209.","The study’s objective was to gauge the impact of California’s Proposition 209, a 1996 repeal of affirmative action, on employment, unemployment, labor force participation, and wages among women and racial minorities.
The author used a nonexperimental design and estimated a difference-in-difference-in-differences regression model on monthly Current Population Survey data from 1994 to 2001.
The study found that the employment rate of all minorities in California relative to white men dropped 2.8 percentage points from 1995 to 1999, a statistically significant decrease.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the author did not control for pre-intervention minority employment trends in California relative to the rest of the United States or preemptive hiring decisions that might have anticipated the law’s passage. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to California’s affirmative action repeal through Proposition 209. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","In 1996, California repealed state affirmative action policies through Proposition 209, leaving federal affirmative action statutes, particularly those applicable to federal contractors, intact. The legislation went into effect in November 1997 after a prolonged legal challenge. Before that time, private and public agency employers in California had been subject to state fair employment practice laws and affirmative action requirements as well as federal legislation. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (the Civil Rights Act) forbids employers from discriminating against their employees on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, or national origin. Affirmative action Executive Order 11246, signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965, reinforced prohibitions in the Civil Rights Act and earlier executive orders, requiring the federal government and federal contractors with 50 or more employees or $50,000 in contracts to develop written affirmative action plans and ensure equal opportunities for all workers.","The author estimated difference-in-difference-in-differences regression models using individual-level monthly Current Population Survey outgoing rotation group data from 1994 to 2001. Data from Washington State were not included in the analysis because the state enacted a comparable affirmative action ban in 1998. The analysis estimated impacts of the affirmative action repeal through Proposition 209 on white, African American, and Hispanic women and on African American and Hispanic men separately. The outcomes of interest were employment rates, unemployment rates, labor force nonparticipation rates, and wages in three post-intervention years (1999, 2000, and 2001). Impacts were identified as the difference between changes in outcomes for groups covered by affirmative action legislation relative to other groups in California and changes in outcomes for covered groups relative to other groups in all states except Washington. The regression models controlled for age, marital status, educational attainment, month of interview, central city location status, nativity, and citizenship status.","The study found that the employment rate of all minorities in California relative to white men dropped 2.8 percentage points from 1995 to 1999, a statistically significant decrease.
The employment rate of white women in California relative to white men fell significantly by 3.4 percentage points over this period, while the corresponding relative employment rate for Hispanic women in the state fell significantly by 4.8 percentage points.
Labor force nonparticipation rates relative to white men in this period increased significantly by 2.9 percentage points for white women, 4.6 percentage points for African American women, and 5.2 percentage points for Hispanic women.
Findings were similar for outcomes measured in 2000 and 2001.","Although the difference-in-difference-in-differences regression model controlled for many sources of variation related to the outcomes of interest, several potential confounding factors remained. First, the author did not address the possibility that the employment effects attributed to Proposition 209 might also reflect trends already in motion among the demographic groups in California and elsewhere before the legislation was enacted. Second, the author noted that the governor of California issued an executive order related to affirmative action in 1995, the year from which pre-intervention data were drawn. Because this executive order could have affected employers’ hiring decisions, differences in minority employment from 1995 to 1999 might capture the consequences of both this executive order and Proposition 209, rather than Proposition 209 alone.
Finally, the author estimated many related impacts on outcomes related to employment, earnings, and labor force participation. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The author did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","",""

The authors discussed five original, observational studies. Two studies conducted regression analyses using survey data. One used an interrupted time series design and data from Vanguard on employees at 13 companies. Two additional studies conducted regression analyses using Vanguard data on 1.5 million participants in 1,830 of Vangaurd’s defined contribution retirement plans.
The study receiving a moderate rating (study 5) found that members of retirement plans that offer retirement date funds, relative to members of retirement plans that offer risk-based funds or neither, held comparatively more equity when they were younger and comparatively less equity when they were older.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because study 5 was a quasi-experimental design with adequate controls. We must note, however, that the remaining four studies provide causal evidence rated as low. The overall moderate evidence rating means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the employees’ access to asset allocation funds, but other factors might also have contributed. In the case of the remaining four studies, however, we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the interventions analyzed. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","","","Study 1. Significantly more 401(k) plan members expressed interest in joining a program that automatically increased contribution rates after 12 months than in programs that automatically increased rates after 0 through 11 months.
Study 2. Survey respondents expressed significantly greater interest in savings programs that linked contribution rate increases to pay rates than in programs that increased contribution rates after a fixed interval, with 38 percent describing themselves as very or extremely interested in the synchronized version of the program compared with only 32 percent for the nonsynchronized version.
Study 3. Changing to automatic enrollment in a contribution escalator program led participation in the program to increase from 25.1 to 83.5 percent.
Study 4. The availability of asset allocation funds mitigated the relationship between contribution amounts and the probability of equity holdings, although both monthly contributions and the availability of asset allocation funds remained statistically significant predictors of equity holdings.
Study 5. Members of retirement plans that offered retirement date funds, relative to members of retirement plans that offered risk-based funds or neither, held comparatively more equity when they were younger and comparatively less equity when they were older.","The first four studies in this report did not demonstrate adequate statistical controls for factors other than the intervention that might have contributed to the outcome of interest. For example, in studies 1 and 2, which described survey responses, the authors did not describe how respondents were assigned to survey versions or whether respondents’ background characteristics were comparable across versions. Assignment to treatment conditions in these studies might have been random, which would lead us to expect comparable distributions of background characteristics in all conditions, but the Clearinghouse for Labor Evaluation and Research (CLEAR) was unable to confirm the assignment mechanism. If assignment to treatment was not random, variation in these background characteristics could also explain variation in responses, weakening the causal relationship the authors sought to establish.
The fifth study employed a quasi-experimental design that comprehensively controlled for observable characteristics that could influence the outcome of interest. Controls included plan-level measures of the proportion of participants’ demographics; average contributions, account balances, and membership durations; proportion of web-registered users; log number of participants; and indicators for whether the plan offered loans, company stock, or a brokerage account. The authors also provided a detailed discussion explaining that the availability of certain kinds of funds was not related to unobservable employee characteristics. However, quasi-experimental designs cannot control for these unobservable characteristics, which can also influence the outcome of interest.","",""

The study included middle school girls who attended a conference designed to improve their attitudes toward and interest in science. Participants were randomly assigned to the treatment condition, which included standard conference sessions on science careers and a session on gender discrimination in the sciences, or to the control group that attended only the standard sessions. The authors administered pre- and post-conference surveys to measure the impact of the intervention.
The study found significant increases in reported science self-efficacy and science utility value among the girls in the treatment condition, whereas girls in the control condition experienced a decrease in egalitarian attitudes toward science.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is high because it was a well-implemented randomized controlled trial with low attrition. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the intervention and not to other factors.","","","This study was a randomized controlled trial, including 158 girls ages 11 to 14 years old, of whom 62 were assigned to the treatment group and 96 were assigned to the control group. The study took place during a one-day “Expanding Your Horizons” conference designed to increase middle school girls’ interest in science.
Students in the treatment group participated in four one-hour sessions. Three of these sessions, each led by a female scientist, focused on the presenter’s career and included a hands-on science activity. A trained psychology graduate student led the fourth one-hour session, which defined gender discrimination in the sciences, described how gender discrimination affected female scientists, and highlighted four female scientists who had encountered gender discrimination over the course of their careers. Students in the control group participated in four one-hour sessions led by female scientists, all focusing on their careers and including a hands-on science activity.
The authors administered pre- and post-conference attitudinal surveys to the treatment and control group members. The surveys included items measuring participants’ perceptions of gender discrimination; task-specific attitudes (egalitarian attitudes toward science, scientific self-efficacy, and science’s utility value); interest in science; and estimates of female representation in science.","The study found that self-efficacy increased among girls in the treatment condition but not in the control condition.1
The study found that girls in the treatment condition rated the utility value of science significantly higher in the post-survey than in the pre-survey, whereas girls in the control condition exhibited no difference across surveys.
The study found that the average level of egalitarian attitudes toward science decreased significantly among girls in the control, but not the treatment, condition.
The study found no pre- or post-test differences in interest in science for girls in either group.","The authors noted that the topic of the conference likely attracted girls who already had an increased interest in science. In addition, the authors surmised that by giving the study participants a survey at the beginning of the conference, they became aware of the point of the study and might have adjusted their responses on the survey administered after the study to conform to researchers’ expectations.","","1 CLEAR reviewers used the author-reported pre- and post-test means by treatment group to compare the change in attitudes over the course of the conference among girls in the treatment group to the same change among girls in the control group.

When analyzing outcomes within gender, the authors did not conduct any statistical testing to estimate differences in the STEM course grades of students who participated in Supplemental Instruction and those who did not.

Riverside included 3 of 16 sites across the United States to receive funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to implement a program intended to improve welfare recipients’ employment outcomes. (The authors reported results for two other sites in Riverside separately, so CLEAR also reviewed the results for those sites separately.)
Riverside PASS aimed to improve employment retention and career advancement among employed individuals who recently left TANF. Local PASS service providers contacted eligible individuals who were randomly assigned into the treatment group. Program participants received post-employment services and supportive service payments based on their needs.

The study found that, compared with those who registered for Labor Exchange services, Private Career School program participants had higher employment and earnings, and lower receipt of several types of public benefits.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not ensure that the groups compared were similar before program participation.

The Private Career School program facilitated training for specific occupations, including cosmetology, truck driving, and computer programming. Private institutions operated the programs and the Washington State Workforce Training and Education Coordinating Board monitored them.","The authors used a nonexperimental statistical approach called propensity-score matching to create a comparison group of people who registered at the Labor Exchange and who were similar to Private Career School program participants in terms of demographic characteristics, including gender, age, educational attainment, race, and employment and earnings history. The authors collected Unemployment Insurance records for those who had exited a Private Career School program or Labor Exchange from July 2001 to June 2002 to estimate the long-term impacts of the Private Career School program in quarters 9 to 12 after program exit. They also collected Unemployment Insurance records for those who exited the Private Career School program or Labor Exchange from July 2003 to June 2004 to estimate the short-term impacts in the 3 quarters following program exit. The 10,363 Private Career School participants who exited in 2001–2002 were matched to a sample of 8,003 comparison group members, which was drawn from the 179,691 adults who registered at the Labor Exchange.

The authors then compared the employment, hourly wages, quarterly hours worked, quarterly earnings, and public benefits receipt of the Private Career School and comparison groups before and after participation. Program participants were on average 30 years old; about 57 percent of participants were female and about 30 percent were minorities.","Employment. The study found that, compared with those registered for Labor Exchange services, the employment rate for Private Career School participants increased by 4.8 percentage points more 3 quarters after exit and 4.3 percentage points more 9 to 12 quarters after program exit. In addition, compared with those registered for Labor Exchange services, the number of hours worked per quarter for Private Career School participants increased by 40.7 hours more 3 quarters after exit and by 21 hours more 9 to 12 quarters after program exit.
Earnings. The study found that average quarterly earnings increased by $624 more 3 quarters after program exit and $312 more 9 to 12 quarters after program exit for those who took part in the Private Career School program compared with those registered for Labor Exchange services. Compared with those registered for Labor Exchange services, the average hourly wage for Private Career School participants increased by $1.69 3 quarters after exit and 94 cents 9 to 12 quarters after program exit.
Public benefits receipt: The study found that, compared with those who registered for Labor Exchange services, the percentage of Private Career School participants who received Unemployment Insurance benefits decreased by .9 percentage points more 3 quarters after program exit and by 2.1 percentage points more 9 to 12 quarters after program exit. Compared with those registered in the Labor Exchange program, the amount of Unemployment Insurance benefits received among Private Career School participants decreased by $17.70 more 9 to 12 quarters after program exit. The study also found that, compared with those registered in the Labor Exchange program, the receipt of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families benefits among the Private Career School participants decreased more 3 quarters (by 0.9 percentage points and $22.90 less) after program exit, but increased more 9 to 12 quarters after program exit (by 0.7 percentage points and $11.90 more). The findings were similar for food stamp benefits as the rate of receipt and benefit amount decreased more for Private Career School participants 3 quarters after exit (by 5.0 percentage points and $41.70 less), but the amount received increased by $7.60 more 9 to 12 quarters after exit compared with the Labor Exchange group. Compared with those registered in the Labor Exchange program, the percentage of participants in the Private Career School group who were enrolled in Medicaid decreased by 3.3 percentage points more 3 quarters after program exit.","Although the authors accounted for many characteristics of the treatment and comparison groups in their analysis, the decision to define the groups based on their date of program exit rather than program entry is problematic. For example, if the average length of participation was 6 months for the Private Career School group compared with one month for the Labor Exchange group and we compared the groups’ earnings 6 months after their recorded exit dates, we would see Private Career School participants’ earnings about 12 months after they started receiving services and Labor Exchange participants’ earnings about 7 months after they started receiving services. If everyone stayed on their original upward-sloping wage trajectory, it would appear as though the Private Career School participants earned more 6 months after their exit dates. However, this would not be attributable to receiving Private Career School services; it would be caused by the difference in elapsed time across the groups (12 months for Private Career School participants versus 7 months for Labor Exchange participants). Therefore, studies defining the groups based on exit date instead of entry date without accounting for program length can receive only a low evidence rating.","",""

[WIA Youth]","The study’s objective was to examine the impact of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) Youth program on the employment rate and earnings of low-income youth.
The authors used a nonexperimental method to compare the short-term (3 quarters after program exit) and long-term (9 to 12 quarters after program exit) employment, earnings, and public benefits receipt between those who took part in the WIA Youth program relative to those who registered for services at the Labor Exchange.
The study found that, compared with those who registered for Labor Exchange services, WIA Youth program participants had lower employment, with mixed findings for earnings.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not ensure that the groups compared were similar before program participation. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the WIA Youth program; other factors are likely to have contributed.

The Youth Program services, which remained essentially the same under WIOA, were designed to provide quality employment and training services to eligible workers. Administered through local workforce investment areas, the Youth Program served people ages 14 to 21 years old through a set of core services; these included job placement assistance, skills assessments, and provision of information on the labor market. In addition, those unable to obtain a job through core services alone could receive intensive services—which included counseling and specialized assessments—and vouchers for attending training. Recipients of public assistance and other low-income people received priority for intensive and training services in local workforce investment areas in which program funds were limited. In addition, some local areas provided supportive services such as child care, transportation, and work-related financial assistance to those who qualified.","The authors used a nonexperimental statistical approach called propensity-score matching to create a comparison group of people who registered at the Labor Exchange and who were similar to WIA Youth program participants in terms of demographic characteristics, including gender, age, educational attainment, race, and employment and earnings history. The authors collected Unemployment Insurance records for those who had exited a WIA Youth Program or Labor Exchange from July 2001 to June 2002 to estimate the long-term impacts of the WIA Youth Program in quarters 9 to 12 after program exit. They also collected Unemployment Insurance records for those who exited the WIA Youth Program or Labor Exchange from July 2003 to June 2004 to estimate the short-term impacts in the 3 quarters following program exit. The 1,974 WIA Youth participants who exited in 2001–2002 were matched to a sample of 782 comparison group members, which was drawn from the 24,203 youths who registered at the Labor Exchange. The 3,424 WIA Youth participants who exited in 2003–2004 were matched to a sample of 1,179 comparison group members, which was drawn from the 22,143 youths who registered at the Labor Exchange. The authors then compared the two groups on employment, quarterly hours worked, quarterly earnings, and hourly wages. Program participants were on average 17 years old; 40 percent of participants were female and about 40 percent were minorities.","Employment. The study found that, compared with those registered for Labor Exchange services, the employment rate for the WIA Youth program group increased by 10.3 percentage points 9 to 12 quarters after program exit. Compared with those registered for Labor Exchange services, the number of hours worked per quarter for the WIA Youth Program group decreased by 13 hours 3 quarters after program exit and increased by 31.1 hours 9 to 12 quarters after program exit.
Earnings. The study found that, 3 quarters after program exit, average quarterly earnings decreased by $235; 9 to 12 quarters after program exit, those earnings increased by $288 for those who took part in the WIA Youth Program compared with those registered for Labor Exchange services. Compared with those registered for Labor Exchange services, the average hourly wage for the WIA Youth Program group increased by 68 cents 9 to 12 quarters after program exit.","Although the authors accounted for many characteristics of the treatment and comparison groups in their analysis, the decision to define the groups based on their date of program exit rather than program entry is problematic. For example, if the average length of participation was 6 months for the WIA Youth group compared with one month for the Labor Exchange group and we compared the groups’ earnings 6 months after their recorded exit dates, we would see WIA Youth participants’ earnings about 12 months after they started receiving services and Labor Exchange participants’ earnings about 7 months after they started receiving services. If everyone stayed on their original upward-sloping wage trajectory, it would appear as though the WIA Youth participants earned more 6 months after their exit dates. However, this would not be attributable to receiving WIA Youth program services; it would be caused by the difference in elapsed time across the groups (12 months for WIA Youth participants versus 7 months for Labor Exchange participants). Therefore, studies defining the groups based on exit date instead of entry date without accounting for program length can receive only a low evidence rating.","",""

The Corpus Christi site was one of three in Texas that participated in the Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) project.
The authors randomly assigned about 1,300 single-parent participants in Corpus Christi’s Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program to either a treatment group, which received ERA services, or a control group, which received standard TANF services. The authors analyzed data from Unemployment Insurance (UI), TANF, and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) administrative records.
The study did not find statistically significant effects 18 to 24 months after random assignment on employment, earnings, and public benefit receipt.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that any estimated effects would be attributable to the ERA program and not to other factors. However, the study found no statistically significant impacts.","","The ERA project was introduced in 1999 as a nationwide exploration of factors that help welfare recipients not only find employment but retain their positions and advance in their careers. Corpus Christi was one of 16 sites across the United States to receive funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to implement a program intended to improve welfare recipients’ employment outcomes. (Two other sites in Texas were evaluated separately and are therefore reported separately by CLEAR.)
TANF recipients assigned to the Texas ERA program attended an initial orientation and then a four-day job-search workshop. They then spent four to six weeks searching for jobs. The program assigned those who did not then secure employment to community service or volunteer positions. People who found jobs were eligible for a $200 monthly stipend for up to 12 months if they were employed for at least 30 hours per week, participated in a post-employment “advancement” activity, or left TANF; they could also receive the stipend if they worked 15 hours per week and participated in an education and training activity. The first 4 months of earnings for people in the program were disregarded when calculating their eligibility for the stipend. Texas ERA staff also helped clients with job-related problems, reemployment assistance, and support in meeting stipend requirements. Program staff made regular employer site visits. Participants were eligible for these services as long as they were eligible for the monthly stipend. Program staff coordinated case management services (including employment assessment, goal setting and career planning, support services, barrier resolution, and job-search assistance) across several partner agencies.","From November 2000 through December 2002, 1,723 single-parent participants were randomly assigned to the ERA program or the Choices program (control group) in Corpus Christi after TANF eligibility had been confirmed but before participants started to receive cash assistance. Participants assigned to the ERA program attended a TANF orientation. They then received cash assistance and began participating in ERA activities. Participation in both the ERA and Choices conditions was mandatory for 75 percent of those randomly assigned. Participants from two-parent families were also randomly assigned, but, with too few two-parent families to report separately on their outcomes, the report excluded them from the analysis.
The authors focused on single-parent participants randomly assigned from October 2000 through June 2002 in Corpus Christi (the report included contradictory information on the month in which random assignment began). Participants assigned from October 2000 through June 2002 represented 76 percent of the sample randomly assigned for Corpus Christi, for an analytic sample of 1,306.","The study did not find statistically significant effects 18 to 24 months after random assignment on employment, earnings, and public benefits receipt.","The authors noted that the study compared an experimental program with a long-established, well-developed existing welfare system—Texas Choices—that strengthened and expanded over the course of the study. This could have weakened the contrast between the services received by the treatment and control groups.","",""

The authors used a nonexperimental method to compare the short-term (3 quarters after program exit) and long-term (9 to 12 quarters after program exit) employment, earnings, and public benefits receipt between those who took part in the ABE program relative to those who registered for services at the Labor Exchange.
The study found that, compared with those who registered for Labor Exchange services, ABE program participants had higher employment and earnings, and lower public benefits receipt.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not ensure that the groups compared were similar before program participation. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the ABE program; other factors are likely to have contributed.
This study also examined the effectiveness of other workforce development programs.

Community-based organizations or community and technical colleges offered training to improve adults’ literacy, knowledge, and skills for employment and self-sufficiency; facilitate training in education to parents for supporting their children’s education; and support adults in completing high school-level education.
Training included literacy classes, family skills, workplace skills enhancement, English language classes, citizenship classes, basic skills education, high school equivalency preparation, and alternative high school diploma programs.","The authors used a nonexperimental statistical approach called propensity-score matching to create a comparison group of people who registered at the Labor Exchange and who were similar to ABE program participants in terms of demographic characteristics, including gender, age, race, and employment and earnings history. The authors collected Unemployment Insurance records for those who had exited the ABE program or Labor Exchange from July 2001 to June 2002 to estimate the long-term impacts of the ABE program in quarters 9 to 12 after program exit. They also collected Unemployment Insurance records for those who exited the ABE program or Labor Exchange from July 2003 to June 2004 to estimate the short-term impacts in the 3 quarters following program exit. The 13,478 ABE participants who exited in 2001–2002 were matched to a sample of 7,269 comparison group members, which was drawn from the 188,172 adults who registered at the Labor Exchange. The 7,815 ABE participants who exited in 2003–2004 were matched to a sample of 5,852 comparison group members, which was drawn from the 164,811 adults who registered at the Labor Exchange. The authors then compared the employment, hourly wages, quarterly hours worked, quarterly earnings, and public benefits of the ABE and comparison groups before and after participation. Program participants were on average 31 years old; 60 percent of participants were female and about 58 percent were minorities.","Employment. The study found that, compared with that of those registered for Labor Exchange services, the employment rate for the ABE program group increased by 5.9 percentage points more 9 to 12 quarters after program exit. In addition, compared with that of those registered for Labor Exchange services, the number of hours worked per quarter for the ABE program group increased by 11.8 hours more 3 quarters after program exit and 18.5 hours more 9 to 12 quarters after program exit.
Earnings. The study found that average quarterly earnings increased by $182 more in the third quarter after program exit for those who took part in the ABE program compared with that of those registered for Labor Exchange services. The average hourly wage for the ABE program group also increased by 56 cents more in the third quarter after program exit.
Public benefits receipt: The study found that, compared with those registered for Labor Exchange services, the percentage of participants in the ABE program group who received Unemployment Insurance benefits decreased by 0.8 percentage points more 3 quarters after exit and by 1.3 percentage points more 9 to 12 quarters after program exit. The amount of Unemployment Insurance benefits received in the ABE program group also decreased by $10.70 more 9 to 12 quarters after program exit. Compared with the Labor Exchange group, the percentage of ABE participants who received Temporary Assistance for Needy Families benefits increased about 2.5 percentage points more and the amount received increased by about $40 more 3 and 9 to 12 quarters after program exit. The findings were similar for food stamp benefits; the percentage of recipients and the amount received increased more for ABE participants than for the comparison group 3 and 9 to 12 quarters after program exit (4.3 percentage points and $43 more, and 6.4 percentage points and $67 more, respectively). Compared with those registered for Labor Exchange services, the percentage of participants in the ABE program group who were enrolled in Medicaid increased by 5.3 percentage points more 3 quarters after exit and by 6.0 percentage points more 9 to 12 quarters after program exit.","Although the authors accounted for many characteristics of the treatment and comparison groups in their analysis, the decision to define the groups based on their date of program exit rather than program entry is problematic. For example, if the average length of participation was 6 months for the ABE group compared with one month for the Labor Exchange group and we compared the groups’ earnings 6 months after their recorded exit dates, we would see ABE participants’ earnings about 12 months after they started receiving services and Labor Exchange participants’ earnings about 7 months after they started receiving services. If everyone stayed on their original upward-sloping wage trajectory, it would appear as though the ABE participants earned more 6 months after their exit dates. However, this would not be attributable to receiving ABE services; it would be caused by the difference in elapsed time across the groups (12 months for ABE participants versus 7 months for Labor Exchange participants). Therefore, studies defining the groups based on exit date instead of entry date without accounting for program length can receive only a low evidence rating.","",""

The author estimated the effect of the mentoring program using administrative data to compare outcomes among youth released from a juvenile rehabilitation facility who applied to participate in the program with the outcomes of similar youth who did not apply.
The study did not find any statistically significant effects of the mentoring program on recidivism.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it was based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design. This means we are somewhat confident that any estimated effects would be attributable to the Washington State Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration’s mentoring program, but other factors might also have contributed. However, the study did not find statistically significant effects.","","The mentoring program aimed to assist youth in setting and fulfilling educational and vocational goals and in living drug- and crime-free upon their release from a juvenile rehabilitation facility. Youth were matched with adult mentors based on their gender, ethnicity, personality, and interests as assessed by the program manager. Mentors were expected to meet monthly with and call or write weekly to youth during the last five to six months of the youths’ confinement in the rehabilitation facility. After the youth returned to the community, mentors were expected to meet with them weekly.","In this study, the treatment group included 78 youth released from a Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration facility to King and Pierce Counties from February 1997 to September 2000. All of these youth had applied to participate in the mentoring program. The 78 youth in the comparison group—who did not apply to participate in the mentoring program—were released during the same time period to King, Pierce, or Snomish Counties, and were matched to the treatment group youth on release timing, gender, race and ethnicity, number of previous admissions to a juvenile rehabilitation facility, and risk for reoffense. The author estimated the effect of the mentoring program by comparing the average recidivism outcomes among youth in the treatment and comparison groups.","The study did not find any statistically significant effects of the mentoring program on recidivism for any crime, felonies, or violent felonies at one, two, or three years after release.","Although the treatment was defined as participating in the mentoring program, it is unclear what this meant in practice. For instance, the report did not provide information about whether all youth were matched with mentors, or had to have a certain number of contacts with a mentor, to count as participants. In addition, the report did not explain the process of selecting participants for the mentoring program or whether all applicants were selected into the program. Comparison youth did not apply to participate in the mentoring program, which might indicate a difference in their underlying commitment to rehabilitation. In addition, the study included a small number of youth in the treatment and comparison groups, making it difficult to detect statistically significant program impacts.","",""

The author analyzed a subsample of participants in the National Evaluation of Welfare-to-Work Strategies (NEWWS) study. The study was a randomized controlled trial that assigned individuals within a geographic location to one of three groups: LFA, HCD, or a control group.
The study found that women in the 35-year-old group who participated in LFA or HCD had higher earnings and needed less time to find a job than those in the other age cohorts.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the study was a randomized controlled trial with unknown attrition and the authors did not account for preexisting differences between the groups being compared in their analysis. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to LFA or HCD programs; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Both LFA and HCD were approaches implemented as part of NEWWS. The two programs differed in their approach to transitioning participants to work: the LFA program encouraged participants to enter employment as quickly as possible, and the HCD program encouraged participants to receive education and training before entering employment. These interventions were mandated for the study participants assigned to each group, and people in those groups who did not participate were subject to sanctions that reduced their public assistance benefits.","The study included a subsample of 4,637 African American women from the Atlanta, Georgia, site of the NEWWS study, which was a multisite study commissioned by the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services. The participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: LFA, HCD, or to a control group that had the option to seek educational or employment opportunities without sanctions. Analyses were conducted separately based on three age categories: 25, 35, and 45 years old.
The women in the study were eligible if they (1) were part of the NEWWS study; (2) applied for Aid to Families with Dependent Children benefits; (3) resided in Atlanta, Georgia; (4) were African American; and (5) had children. The number of women with one child, two children, and three or more children in the sample was roughly even—36.4 percent had one child, 33.3 percent had two children, and 30.4 percent had three or more children.
The public use data files the author analyzed included earned income, employment retention, time elapsed before finding employment, income for two years before the study, number of quarters employed year before the study, age, number of children, marital status, and educational attainment variables. The author used analysis of covariance to statistically account for differences that existed among the groups before the study and examined earnings, time to employment, and job retention for five years following random assignment.","The study found that 35-year-old women who participated in LFA or HCD had higher earnings after five years than 35-year-old women in the control group.
The study also found that 35-year-old women in the LFA group had the shortest time to employment when examining the five years after the program began, but the time for the HCD group was also significantly shorter than that of the same-age control group.","Although the study was a randomized controlled trial by design, the level of attrition was unknown and therefore the study is ineligible to receive a high causal evidence rating; thus, it was treated as a nonexperimental design for this review. The author did not demonstrate that the incomes of people in each study group were statistically equivalent more than one year before random assignment, so the study could not receive a moderate causal evidence rating, either. The author noted large differences at baseline for the three study groups based on their age, income, education, and work experience. Therefore any observed relationships between the LFA and HCD programs and employment outcomes might reflect these existing differences, and not the effect of the programs.","",""

The authors applied a fixed-effects regression model to workforce data in the EEO-1 Employer Information Reports. These data were supplemented by a survey of compliance enforcement activities administered to a random sample of establishments drawn from the EEO-1 reports.
The study found that compliance reviews begun in the 1970s increased an establishment’s share of women and African Americans employed as managers, not only in the 1970s but also through the 1980s and 1990s.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the study did not adequately control for existing differences between the study groups. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to OFCCP compliance reviews or to lawsuits. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, employers are forbidden from discriminating against their employees on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, or national origin. The law prohibits discrimination in terms, compensation, working conditions, and other aspects of employment; mandates enforcement by courts, rather than juries; and provides civil penalties for violations, including mandatory remedial hiring policies for employers and reinstatement with back pay awards to victims. It also created the EEOC to bring class action litigation against employers for discrimination. The Civil Rights Act initially applied to private sector employers with more than 25 employees; since 1972, it has applied to those with more than 15 employees.
Affirmative action Executive Order 11246, signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965, reinforced prohibitions in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and earlier executive orders against discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin; subsequent orders and revisions have added sex (1967) and sexual orientation and gender identity (2014) as protected classes. Order 11246 required the federal government and federal contractors with 50 or more employees or $50,000 in contracts to develop written affirmative action plans and ensure equal opportunities for all workers. The order authorized the Secretary of Labor to establish the OFCCP to enforce federal contractors’ compliance. The OFCCP targets for compliance reviews those employers whose EEO-1 reports indicate relatively low employment of women and minorities. The authors noted that the nature of compliance reviews differed over time. Relative to later reviews, reviews in the 1970s were less frequent but more intrusive and more likely to lead to sanctions.","The authors designed an organizational survey and administered it to a random sample of establishments to gather data on the incidence and dates of compliance reviews and lawsuits. The sample was drawn from the 1999 EEO-1 Employer Information Report, a workforce survey. Before 1982, private employers with at least 50 employees and federal contractors with at least 25 employees were required to file EEO-1 reports; since then, the size requirements have risen to 100 or 50 employees, respectively. The organizational survey response rate was 67 percent. Matching the organizational survey data to EEO-1 data from 1971 to 2002 yielded an analytic sample of 814 establishments.
The authors used regression analyses to examine the effects of compliance reviews and lawsuits on four measures of managerial diversity—the proportion of managers who were white men, white women, African American men, and African American women. In the benchmark model, the authors considered the cumulative number of reviews or lawsuits filed against an establishment to be the predictor of interest; an alternative formulation examined the interaction between the enforcement occurring during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s and establishments’ minority employment shares. Models included fixed establishment effects and time-varying control variables, including federal contractor status, involvement in other regulatory activities (such as whether the establishment adopted an affirmative action plan), organizational characteristics related to human resource policies and unionization, organizational demography, and organizational environment characteristics (such as state and industry employment rates).","The study found that compliance reviews initiated against an establishment in the 1970s significantly increased the share of women and African Americans it employed as managers, not only in the 1970s but also through the 1980s and 1990s. A first compliance review in the 1970s increased the odds of white women in management by an estimated 34 percent, of African American women by 18 percent, and of African American men by 28 percent.
Compliance reviews initiated in the 1970s led to significantly greater increases in female and African American employment shares than did reviews conducted in the 1980s.
Larger numbers of lawsuits significantly increased employment shares for women and African Americans.","The authors compared female and African American employment shares among establishments that were party to litigation or a compliance review as a result of allegedly discriminatory practices with shares among establishments that were later or never involved in such activities. However, it is unclear whether establishments facing differing numbers of lawsuits or reviews were similar before the initiation of those lawsuits or reviews. For example, establishments facing more lawsuits or reviews might have tended to have smaller female or African American employment shares relative to other establishments; their lower managerial diversity might have triggered the lawsuits or reviews. Because the comparability of establishments with different numbers of lawsuits or reviews was not established, the relationship between lawsuits and reviews and managerial diversity could reflect not only the effect of reviews and lawsuits on managerial diversity, but also the effects of other factors.
In addition, the authors estimated multiple related impacts on female and African American employment outcomes. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found to be statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","",""

The study used a nonexperimental design to compare the earnings of program participants before and after the intervention, relative to the earnings of nonparticipants who were eligible and offered services but chose not to participate in a training program. The authors used administrative records from the Commonwealth Corporation of Massachusetts for their analysis.
The study found that, although the participants in the Massachusetts JTPA program earned significantly less than nonparticipants during the year of the program, participants earned significantly more one year ($1,876) and two years ($2,285) after the program, compared with nonparticipants.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it was based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to JTPA, but other factors might also have contributed.","","The JTPA workforce development program took place in the 1990s in Massachusetts and provided training for economically disadvantaged adults. Adults who received welfare benefits or had family incomes below the federal poverty level were eligible for the program. JTPA programs also targeted hard-to-serve populations, such as people without a high school degree, ex-offenders, homeless people, and people with disabilities. All those interested in the program first completed an assessment to determine program eligibility, and then eligible people received the opportunity to participate in training activities. The study did not provide details on the specific topics covered in the training activities.","Using administrative data from the Commonwealth Corporation of Massachusetts, the authors compared the earnings of people who participated in the Massachusetts JTPA workforce development program with those who completed the assessment, were eligible for the program, and were offered services but did not participate in a training program. The analysis accounted for demographic characteristics such as gender, age, race, education level, and disability status, as well as math, reading, and basic skills levels. The analysis sample included 5,586 JTPA program participants and 4,025 comparison nonparticipants. The sample was predominantly female and economically disadvantaged.","The study found that, during the year of the program, participants in the Massachusetts JTPA workforce development program earned $610 less than nonparticipants. This difference was statistically significant.

The author used historical data from official court records to compare the recidivism outcomes of youth who participated in the drug court with a comparison group of drug court-eligible youth who did not become drug court clients.
The study found that participation in the juvenile drug court program was associated with lower overall recidivism 16 months or later after completion of the program.

This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the drug court; other factors likely contributed.","","The Eleventh Judicial District Juvenile Drug Court has served juvenile drug offenders in San Juan County, New Mexico, since 2000. To be eligible for the program, youth must not have prior violent felony adjudications, prior sex offenses, or current first degree felony offenses. The current offense must also be drug- or alcohol-related. The drug court approach includes mandatory, frequent drug testing and close supervision while providing drug treatment placements and other services, with the goal of reducing drug use and recidivism.","The author used historical court records to compare the recidivism outcomes of youth who participated in the drug court with a comparison group of drug court-eligible youth who did not become drug court clients. Youth in the comparison group were under the supervision of the local probation department. The treatment and comparison groups were matched on sex, race and ethnicity, age, type of offense, presence of a substance abuse history, geographical location, drug court eligibility criteria, and date of exit from supervision.","The study found a statistically significant relationship between participating in the drug court and overall recidivism, which included new juvenile referrals and new adult arrests.","Although the author matched treated youth to drug court-eligible youth who did not participate on a number of important indicators of demographic characteristics and previous offenses, statistically significant differences between the groups remained on their enrollment status in school and employment at the time of drug court intake. The author did not control for these differences when comparing the outcomes of the two groups of youth. Therefore, the estimated effects could reflect that the drug court participants were more likely to pursue productive activity (in school or work) even in the absence of the drug court program. For this reason, the study cannot receive a moderate evidence rating, the highest rating available to nonexperimental analyses.","",""

The Chicago site was one of 16 nationwide to participate in the Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) project.
The authors randomly assigned 1,615 TANF recipients to either a treatment group, which received enhanced employment services, or a control group, which received benefits as usual. The authors collected employment and earnings data from Illinois Unemployment Insurance (UI) records and Food Stamps and TANF receipt data from Illinois administrative records.
The study found that members of the ERA group were more likely to be employed (70 versus 66 percent) in the first year after random assignment and received significantly less in TANF benefits ($1,307, compared with $1,586 among control group members). Effects on employment and benefits receipt persisted into the second year after random assignment.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated impacts are attributable to the Chicago ERA program, and not to other factors.","","The ERA project was introduced in 1999 as a nationwide exploration of factors that help welfare recipients not only find employment but retain their positions and advance in their careers. Chicago was one of 16 sites across the United States to receive funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to implement a program intended to improve welfare recipients’ employment outcomes.
In Chicago, people eligible for the program were recipients of TANF who worked 30 hours or more per week for six months or more but were still eligible for TANF. ERA services aimed to increase their earnings. Clients were offered a $50 gift certificate for attending an orientation session and were asked to consent to participation in the study. Consenting clients who were randomly assigned to ERA (operated by a for-profit company) could meet with a career and income advisor who would help them develop a career and income advancement plan. The advisor counseled participants about how to advance in their current jobs and (more commonly) helped them apply for higher-paying jobs in companies that had relationships with the program. Services could include education and training, but fewer than one-quarter of program participants received those services. In addition to the 30-hour work requirement that was part of their TANF participation, clients had to maintain regular contact with their case managers; failure to do so could result in a sanction of their TANF benefits. The staff-client relationship often continued after people left TANF.","Eligible Chicago TANF recipients were randomly assigned to either a treatment group, which could receive enhanced employment services through Chicago ERA, or a control group, which received customary benefits but not enhanced employment services. Randomization took place from February 2002 to March 2003. The authors estimated the program’s effect on employment and earnings 24 months after random assignment using Illinois UI records.
The authors also used Illinois administrative data to estimate the program’s impact on TANF and Food Stamps receipt 24 months after random assignment.","The study found that members of the ERA group were more likely to be employed (70 versus 66 percent) in the first year after random assignment and received less in TANF benefits ($1,307 compared with $1,586 among control group members). These differences were statistically significant.
In the second year after random assignment as well, ERA group members were more likely to have been employed for four consecutive quarters (44 versus 39 percent) and received less in TANF benefits than did control group members ($602 compared with $844).
The study did not find any statistically significant effects on earnings or Food Stamp receipt in the first or second years after random assignment.","Random assignment for the evaluation continued through June 2003. For this study, the authors restricted the population considered to those randomized through February 2003 to ensure two full years of follow-up data for all sample members.

It also examined impacts on several measures of housing security, which are not included in this review.
The authors implemented a randomized controlled trial and estimated regression models to compare outcomes of treatment and comparison families.
The study found that treatment group members received more Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) cash benefits and food stamps than control group members. There were no statistically significant effects of the program on employment, earnings, or receiving education or training.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the housing voucher, and not to other factors.","","The Welfare-to-Work Voucher program aimed to provide low-income families with housing assistance to help them successfully transition from welfare to work. Rental assistance vouchers could be used to rent any unit in the private rental market, as long as it met U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development standards and was priced similarly to unassisted units in the same market. Housing agencies could terminate rental assistance if clients did not participate in work or training activities as required by the Welfare-to-Work program.","The study was based on a randomized controlled trial in which 8,731 low-income families eligible to receive a Welfare-to-Work voucher were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which received the rental assistance voucher, or the control group, which did not receive the voucher but could receive other housing assistance typically offered to welfare clients. Study participants were predominantly female, never married, and were ages 19 to 44. Nearly half of the participants were black non-Hispanic, 21 percent were Hispanic, and 20 percent were white non-Hispanic. Nearly 57 percent had a high school diploma or a General Education Diploma.
Data sources included quarterly unemployment insurance wage records, monthly TANF records, and surveys administered to study participants. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Public Housing Information Center system provided data on whether treatment and control group members received a rental assistance voucher and used it successfully. To estimate the effect of the vouchers on outcomes of interest, the authors compared the outcomes of treatment and control group members.","The study found that treatment group members were more likely to receive quarterly TANF cash benefits than control group members in almost all periods examined. They also received 0.30 more quarters of TANF payments and $289 more in TANF payments across the full 3.5-year study period than the control group.
Treatment group members received food stamps for 0.33 more quarters and received $397 more in total TANF payments than those in the control group over the life of the study.
There were no statistically significant effects of the housing vouchers on employment, earnings, or receipt of education or training.","Although control group members did not receive a voucher at the time of random assignment, they could elect to remain on a waiting list for a housing voucher; 41 percent of control families used a housing voucher at some point during the follow-up period. Meanwhile, only 67 percent of treatment families actually used a voucher. Because the two groups were so similar in their use of housing vouchers, this likely made it more difficult to detect impacts of the program.","The study took place at six housing choice voucher program sites:

The study used a regression model to compare changes over time in the workplace fatalities of states with federal or state enforcement of OSHA regulations.
The study found that states with self-enforcement of OSHA regulations had lower fatality rates relative to states with federal OSHA enforcement; this difference was statistically significant.
The quality of evidence presented in this study is low. This means we are not confident that the differences in workplace fatalities between states with self-enforcement and those with federal enforcement of OSHA regulations are attributable to the method of enforcement.","","States are allowed to control their own OSHA operations as long as they demonstrate to federal OSHA that they can operate at least as effectively as the federal agency, according to state-specific standards. OSHA monitors state programs and provides up to 50 percent of their operating costs. The outcome of primary interest to this study was workplace fatality rates.","The study used a regression model with random effects to compare changes in the workplace fatalities of states with state enforcement and states with federal enforcement of OSHA regulations over time. The model used state characteristics, such as per capita income, population, and political ideology to perform a selection correction.
The analysis used mortality data from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health’s National Traumatic Occupational Fatalities surveillance system for the 50 states from 1981 to 1995.","The study found that states with self-enforcement of OSHA regulations experienced a statistically significant decline in fatality rates relative to states with federal OSHA enforcement.
The mortality reduction was estimated to be from 27 to 36 percent.","The study noted that states with self-enforcement of OSHA regulations had higher levels of workplace mortality rates than states with federal OSHA enforcement over the entire period examined. In addition, the authors did not demonstrate that the trends in injury rates for the two groups of states were similar. Both suggest that even if the two groups of states experienced OSHA administration the same way, they might have experienced different changes in fatality rates over time, even accounting for the factors used in the selection correction. Therefore, we cannot be confident that states with federal enforcement are a valid comparison group for states that self-enforce OSHA regulations.","",""

If both programs were completely ineffective, and everyone stayed on their original upward-sloping wage trajectory, it would appear as though the DSB program participants earned more 6 months after their exit dates. However, this would not be attributable to receiving DSB program services; it would be caused by the different elapsed time across the groups (12 months for DSB program participants versus 7 months for those not receiving DSB support).

The study was based on a randomized controlled trial and estimated the effect of offering welfare recipients the New Visions Project services compared with encouraging recipients to participate in other employment services. The authors used California public benefits and community college administrative data to compare average outcomes among those offered access to New Visions with the average outcomes of those excluded, after adjusting for differences in demographic and pre-intervention characteristics between the groups.
The study found that participants in the New Visions program received $456 more in Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) payments than control group participants in the third year after random assignment.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the New Visions Project, and not to other factors.","","New Visions was a special college program for welfare recipients offered at RCC in Riverside, California. Its goals were to prepare welfare recipients for community college-based occupational training programs, foster life-long learning, and promote job advancement. The program consisted of a one-week orientation session followed by 24 weeks of academic instruction geared to preparation for college and/or occupational training; it included courses in mathematics, English, reading, and office-related computer software. In addition, during the 24 weeks, participants took a guidance class designed to prepare them with critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, job search, interpersonal relationship, and study skills. After the 24-week program, participants were placed in occupational training, but the training was organized into modules of courses with breaks in between so that participants could more readily combine training sessions with work and family demands.
During the core 24 weeks, students took remedial courses in mathematics, English, reading, computer skills, and career planning. In 2002, the fourth year of the demonstration, the community college added a capstone workshop during the last 6 weeks of the 24-week core program, intended to smooth the transition to less-supportive work and study environments. After completing the core program, participants moved into occupational mini-programs, sequences of courses targeted at entry-level jobs in chosen occupations.","This study was based on a randomized controlled experiment run from September 1998 to May 2002. RCC and the Riverside County Department of Public Social Services randomly assigned 1,043 volunteers to a treatment group that was allowed to participate in New Visions or to a control group that was not. Control group members were encouraged to take part in other vocational programs offered through the county’s welfare program, including courses at the same community college. All members of the sample were welfare clients who were parents. The authors used California public benefits and community college administrative data to compare average outcomes among those offered access to New Visions with the average outcomes of those excluded, after adjusting for differences in demographic and pre-intervention characteristics between the groups.","The study found that participants in the New Visions program received $456 more in TANF payments than control group participants in the third year after random assignment. This difference was statistically significant at the 5 percent level.","The authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to employment, earnings, and public benefit receipt. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","",""

 The authors used a matching procedure and several statistical models to compare the outcomes of demonstration and comparison group members, using administrative data.
 The study found that demonstration participants had higher average quarterly earnings, shorter durations of UI benefits, smaller proportions of maximum UI benefits paid, and a lower average total payout of UI benefits. The study found no statistically significant relationship between demonstration participation and employment outcomes.
 The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not ensure that the groups being compared were similar before the intervention. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Worker Profiling Reemployment Services program; other factors are likely to have contributed.","Absence of conflict of interest.","The overall goal of the Worker Profiling Reemployment Services program was to better integrate the functions of the Wisconsin Division of Workforce Solutions’ Job Service, which operates the state’s One-Stop Career Centers (called Job Centers), and the state Division of UI. To reach this goal, the program identified claimants who were likely to exhaust their regular UI benefits and who were likely to need job search assistance services to make a successful transition to new employment, and referred those claimants to reemployment services. The demonstration sites provided reemployment services to claimants in their profiling pools in 2004–2005. The reemployment services included workshops on resume preparation and interviewing skills, an “Introduction to Computers” curriculum, networking as a job search strategy, job referrals, and employment plan reviews. Within the demonstration group, claimants were assigned to two subgroups based on their preparedness for conducting a job search, the quality of their resume and interviewing skills, and employment barriers. Those who were less prepared were assigned to the group that received more intense services.","The Worker Profiling Reemployment Services program was offered in three demonstration sites in Wisconsin: one in Fox Valley and two in Milwaukee. Claimants were directed to either a demonstration or comparison site depending upon the zip code of their residence. The authors matched demonstration participants to comparison group members on demographic characteristics and pre-program employment status and earnings criteria, and then used several statistical models to compare the outcomes of demonstration and comparison group members. This review focuses on the model that included all of the UI claimants (2,180 demonstration and 4,193 comparison) who were invited to participate in the program, regardless of their program uptake. The authors estimated another model that examined the impacts of those demonstration participants who actually participated in the study. Of 2,180 total demonstration claimants, 1,005 (46 percent) chose not to participate in the study, leaving a total of 1,175 participants who did participate and received intervention services.","Employment
There were no significant differences between demonstration participants and comparison group members on employment during the study period (77 percent of the demonstration participants went back to work during the study period, compared with 78 percent of comparison group members) or on employment in the first quarter after a new claim (54 percent for the demonstration group compared with 53 percent for the comparison group).
Earnings 
Demonstration participants reported average quarterly earnings of $3,020 compared with $2,892 for comparison group members. This difference was statistically significant.
UI benefit receipt
The duration of UI benefits for demonstration participants was 0.6 weeks shorter than for comparison group members, a statistically significant difference.
Demonstration participants drew significantly smaller percentages of their total available benefits than did comparison group members (a 2.2 percent difference).
The average total payout for demonstration participants was $147 less than for comparison group members, a statistically significant difference.","The authors reported statistically significant differences in the gender and race/ethnicity of demonstration participants and comparison group members, and did not account for these differences in analyses. These existing differences between the groups—and not the Worker Profiling Reemployment Services program—could explain the observed differences in outcomes.
In addition to reporting results from an analysis of a model that included all claimants who were invited to participate in the study, the authors reported results from an analysis of a model that was restricted only to those claimants who participated in the study. The results of the latter model were qualitatively similar to those of the main model, but none of the findings was statistically significant.","",""

The report’s objective was to examine the impact of the Job Corps program on participants’ long-term earnings, employment, and other outcomes.
Job Corps offered intensive academic classroom instruction and vocational skills training to economically disadvantaged youth. Its effectiveness was evaluated using a randomized controlled trial conducted in 48 states and the District of Columbia.
The study found a number of statistically significant, positive impacts of Job Corps on earnings and employment in the first four follow-up years. However, there were no significant differences between the youth who were offered Job Corps and the control group on employment rate or earnings in the fifth through ninth follow-up years, as measured by administrative data.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-conducted randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the effects estimated in the study are solely attributable to Job Corps, and not to other factors.","This study was conducted by staff from Mathematica Policy Research, which administers CLEAR. Therefore, the review of this study was conducted by an independent consultant trained in applying the CLEAR causal evidence guidelines.","Job Corps is a federally funded program that has operated since 1964. It offers individualized academic education, vocational training, counseling, and job placement assistance to economically disadvantaged youth ages 16 to 24. Services are delivered at Job Corps centers, where most Job Corps students reside while participating in the program. Most participants do not have a general equivalency degree (GED) or high school diploma upon program entry and they participate in the program for an average of eight months.","The study took place at 105 Job Corps outreach and admissions agencies operating in the 48 contiguous United States and the District of Columbia. From November 1994 to December 1995, 15,386 eligible youth were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which could enter the Job Corps program, or the control group, which was not able to enroll in Job Corps but could access other available programs. The randomization procedure assigned about 7 percent of the eligible applicants to the comparison group. All of these youth were in the research sample. About 13 percent of the youth in the treatment group were randomly sampled to participate in a follow-up survey.
Data sources for this study included a follow-up survey conducted four years after random assignment and Social Security earnings record data for nine years after random assignment. To estimate program impacts, the authors compared the means of the treatment and control groups, weighted for sample and survey design.","Using administrative data, the study found that youth randomly assigned to Job Corps were significantly more likely to be employed during each of the first four follow-up years after random assignment than youth in the control group. For example, in the first year after random assignment, 89 percent of those assigned to the Job Corps group were employed, compared with 78 percent of those in the control group. In the fourth year after random assignment, 85 percent of those assigned to the Job Corps group were employed, compared with 83 percent in the control group. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the Job Corps and control group in the likelihood of being employed during the fifth through ninth years of follow-up.
Using the survey data, which authors examined quarterly rather than annually, there were no statistically significant differences in the employment rates of the two groups during any quarter in the first four years of the follow-up period. (Survey data did not examine years five and later.)
Both data sources agreed that youth offered Job Corps had significantly lower earnings compared with the control group in the first year following random assignment, when the Job Corps group would have been engaging in the program and thus not actively participating in the labor force. In the second through fourth years after random assignment, the youth offered Job Corps earned significantly more than the control group, according to at least one of the data sources. However, there were no statistically significant differences in earnings between the groups in follow-up years five through nine, as measured by administrative data.
Finally, using survey data, the study found that the youth offered Job Corps received $3,696 in public benefits four years after random assignment, whereas the control group received $4,156 in public benefits. This difference was statistically significant.","The authors noted that the impacts on earnings using survey data were notably greater than those found when using the administrative data. To investigate this, they estimated impacts using administrative data only for those youth who also responded to the follow-up survey and then compared those impacts with those estimated for youth who did not respond to the survey. The estimated impact was much larger for youth who responded to the survey than for youth who did not, suggesting that the survey results might overstate the true impact of the program on the full sample.
The authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to employment and earnings. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","",""

The Houston site was one of three in Texas that participated in the Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) project.
The authors randomly assigned about 1,800 single-parent participants in Houston’s Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program to either a treatment group, which received ERA services, or a control group, which received standard TANF services. The authors analyzed data from Unemployment Insurance (UI), TANF, and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) administrative records.
The study did not find any statistically significant effects on employment or earnings. However, the study found that treatment group members received, on average, $33 more in TANF benefits in the ninth quarter after random assignment than those in the control group.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the ERA program, and not to other factors.","","The ERA project was introduced in 1999 as a nationwide exploration of factors that help welfare recipients not only find employment but retain their positions and advance in their careers. Houston was one of 16 sites across the United States to receive funding from the Department of Health and Human Services to implement a program intended to improve welfare recipients’ employment outcomes. (Two other sites in Texas were evaluated separately and are therefore reported separately by CLEAR.)
TANF recipients assigned to the Texas ERA program attended an initial orientation and then a four-day job-search workshop. They then spent four to six weeks searching for jobs. The program assigned those who did not then secure employment to community service or volunteer positions. People who found jobs were eligible for a $200 monthly stipend for up to 12 months if they were employed for at least 30 hours per week, participated in a post-employment “advancement” activity, or left TANF; they could also receive the stipend if they worked 15 hours per week and participated in an education and training activity. The first four months of earnings for people in the program were disregarded when calculating their eligibility for the stipend. Texas ERA staff also helped clients with job-related problems, reemployment assistance, and support in meeting stipend requirements. Program staff made regular employer site visits. Participants were eligible for these services as long as they were eligible for the monthly stipend. Program staff coordinated case management services (including employment assessment, goal setting and career planning, support services, barrier resolution, and job-search assistance) across several partner agencies.","From March 2001 through December 2002, 1,952 single-parent participants were randomly assigned to the ERA program or Choices program (control group) after TANF eligibility had been confirmed, but before receiving cash assistance. Participants assigned to the ERA program attended a TANF orientation. They then received cash assistance and began participating in ERA activities. Participation in both the ERA and Choices condition was mandatory for 93 percent of those randomly assigned. Participants from two-parent families were also randomly assigned, but with too few two-parent families to report separately on their outcomes, the report excluded them from the analysis.
The authors focused on single-parent participants who were randomly assigned from March 2001 through June 2002 in Houston. They represented 93 percent of the sample randomly assigned for Houston, accounting for a sample of 1,816.","The study did not find any statistically significant effects on employment or earnings.
The study found that treatment group members received, on average, $33 more in TANF benefits during the ninth quarter after random assignment, compared with the control group. This finding was statistically significant at the five percent level.","The authors noted that the study compared an experimental program with a long-established, well-developed existing welfare system—Texas Choices—that strengthened and expanded over the course of the study. The strength of the existing program could have weakened the contrast between the services received by the treatment and control groups. In addition, the Houston ERA experienced operational challenges throughout the course of the study and did not implement all aspects of the program to the same extent as the other Texas ERA sites.","",""

The authors randomly assigned eligible youth to one of three treatment groups—drug court, drug court with multisystemic therapy, or drug court with multisystemic therapy enhanced by contingency management—or to a control group that received typical family court services.
The study found no statistically significant differences between the groups on measures of recidivism after one year. However, the study found that participants in the treatment groups reported committing fewer delinquent acts than those in the control groups. Effects on drug screens were mixed.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high for recidivism outcomes because they are based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial but moderate for self-reported delinquency and drug screen outcomes because they had high attrition and the authors demonstrated that the groups being compared had similar baseline characteristics.","","The study was a randomized controlled trial designed to test three layers of drug court treatments. The authors randomly assigned eligible participants to one of three treatment groups or a control group, which received typical family court services.
The Charleston County Department of Juvenile Justice referred the drug court-only group (DC) to a drug court and they met with a therapist. Before each appearance in drug court, youth submitted a urine sample for drug testing and each youth, caregiver, and therapist assessed drug use, compliance with rules at home, school behavior, and participation in treatment. Positive drug test results could result in sanctions (from community service requirements to detention). Sustained negative drug test results could result in rewards (from fast food meals to event tickets) and reduced frequency of court appearances (from an initial requirement of appearing weekly to biweekly or monthly appearances).
The multisystemic therapy (DC-MST) group was referred to a drug court (with all the implications described above) and met with a therapist who provided multisystemic therapy, a home-based manualized treatment that emphasized cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques. MST therapists met with families for 2 to 15 hours per week, depending on the family’s specific needs, and had caseloads of only four or five families to ensure each youth benefited from intensive MST services.
The multisystemic therapy enhanced by contingency management (CD-MST-CM) group received the same treatment as the CD-MST group except that the therapists serving this group received an additional day of training on integrating contingency management concepts, skills, and exercises into the MST program. CM focused on addressing substance use behaviors, in addition to substance abuse (which is the focus of MST). CM components in the study included a voucher system to reward clean drug tests, analysis of drug use behavior to inform self-management planning, and providing protocols for self-management.","From January 2000 to June 2003, 2,123 potential participants in the Charleston County Department of Juvenile Justice were screened for alcohol or drug abuse and other inclusion criteria. Of the 165 youth deemed eligible for the study, 161 agreed to participate and were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups or a control group. The authors used an iterative approach to first identify statistically significant outcomes by different combinations of treatment level (DC, DC-MST, and DC-MST-CM) and time period (pre-treatment, 4 months following enrollment, and 12 months following enrollment) before assessing whether each component of the full treatment had an effect on key outcomes.","Recidivism. The study found no differences between any of the groups on measures of recidivism one year following enrollment.
Self-reported delinquent behavior. Youth in all three drug court groups (DC, DC-MST, and DC-MST-CM) reported committing fewer status offenses relative to youth in the family court group. Youth in the DC and DC-MST-CM groups also reported committing fewer crimes against people than youth in the family court group.
Drug screens. Youth in the DC-MST-CM group failed fewer drug screens than youth in the DC group in the first 4 months after enrollment and from the 4th to 12th months after enrollment. Youth in the DC-MST groups failed fewer drug screens than youth in the DC group from the 4th to 12th months after enrollment.","Youth in the DC-MST and DC-MST-CM groups were expected to have greater contact with the service providers than youth in the DC and family court groups. The authors reported that youth in the DC-MST and DC-MST-CM groups received an average of 66 and 57 hours, respectively, of direct or indirect treatment over the four-month period. However, due to poor record-keeping systems for youth in the DC and family court groups, the authors were unable to determine how much contact they had with service providers.
The quality of causal evidence for the recidivism outcomes is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. However, the self-reported delinquency and drug screen outcomes had high sample attrition, making them ineligible to receive a high causal evidence rating. Because the authors demonstrated that the groups being analyzed had similar characteristics before beginning the treatments, these outcomes receive a moderate causal evidence rating.","",""

For this evaluation, QOP was operated by seven community-based organizations, each affiliated with one to three high schools (11 high schools in total).
Eligibility requirements for students included being in 9th grade for the first time during the 1995–1996 academic year (except at one site, for which the relevant academic school year was 1996–1997) and being in the bottom two-thirds of the GPA distribution for their school in 8th grade.

The author compared the outcomes of SSI Waiver Demonstration Project participants with those of nonparticipants using data from SPI project offices and Unemployment Insurance (UI) administrative records.
The study found that during the intervention delivery period, SSI Waiver Demonstration Project participants’ earnings increased relative to (1) people at the same sites who chose not to participate in the demonstration and (2) people at other SPI sites that did not implement the demonstration.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this report is low because the study was a nonexperimental analysis that did not include adequate controls for underlying differences between the groups being compared. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the SSI Waiver Demonstration Project. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The SSI program provides cash assistance to children and adults with disabilities and senior citizens with very limited incomes and assets. The monthly SSI benefit amount is reduced based on the recipient’s unearned and earned income. The first $20 of unearned income are disregarded; for unearned income, such as from the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program, beyond that amount, the SSI benefit is reduced by $1 for every $1. Similarly, for earned income, the first $65 of earned income is disregarded, and the SSI benefit is reduced by $1 for every $2 of earned income beyond that amount.
From 1998 to 2004 the Social Security Administration (SSA) and Rehabilitation Services Administration provided five-year funding for 12 SPI states to implement innovative projects to help people with disabilities find jobs. Four of those states—California, New York, Vermont, and Wisconsin—implemented the SSI Work Incentives Demonstration Project (also known as the SSI Waiver Demonstration Project) from May 2001 to September 2004.
The SSI Work Incentives Demonstration Project aimed to improve employment and earnings outcomes among SPI participants who were SSI recipients with disabilities or blindness. The intervention included four waivers to SSI program rules. Participants in each state could volunteer to enroll in the demonstration, making them eligible to take advantage of the waivers offered.
A three-for-four earnings deduction in which, after the $65 earnings disregard, the SSI benefit is reduced by $1 for every $4 of earned income. (Vermont did not offer this waiver.)
The three-for-four earnings deduction was also applied to certain types of unearned income, including UI, worker’s compensation, state disability, and disability-related benefits paid through private insurance plans.
Participants were allowed to keep up to $8,000 in annual earnings (not to exceed 50 percent of gross earnings) in an independence account that was covered by the resource exclusion. There was typically a $2,000 limit for those accounts.
Participants who did not concurrently receive SSDI benefits were not required to complete a medical continuing disability review.","The study included two different nonexperimental analyses to estimate the demonstration’s impact on participants’ employment rates and earnings. For the first analysis, the author tested whether the employment rates and earnings of waiver participants differed from those of waiver nonparticipants in the same states. In the second analysis, the author compared the outcomes of waiver participants to those of SPI project participants in other states that did not offer the waivers. In both analyses, the treatment group was composed of those who volunteered for the waiver program.
For employment outcomes, the study tested for differences between the treatment and comparison groups using a chi-squared statistic. For earnings, the author conducted an analysis of variance to test for differences in wages between the two groups. The model included controls for type of SSA benefit, primary disability, race, previous education and training completed, and employment status at intake.
Most participants’ data were collected through the SPI project offices. Some sites tracked individual employment themselves, whereas others used UI administrative data.","Excluding the New York site, waiver participants experienced an earnings gain of $388.75 over the life of the project, compared with nonparticipants in the same demonstration sites, whose earnings increased by $262.41.
Waiver participants had a wage increase of $387.78 during the project compared with a $313.20 increase for the comparison group of SPI participants in states not participating in the SSI Waiver Demonstration Project.","The author conducted a nonexperimental analysis comparing waiver participants with nonparticipants. It is possible that underlying differences in people’s underlying characteristics could both influence the decision to participate in the waiver program and future employment and earnings outcomes. To guard against this possibility, the Clearinghouse for Labor Evaluation and Research (CLEAR) requires that the analysis includes controls for demographic characteristics, disability type, and earnings history, among others. The author’s analyses did not include controls for previous earnings history, so the analysis cannot receive a moderate causal evidence rating. In addition, it is unclear how the study measured employment, whether the measure was consistent across states, and the study’s follow-up period; this further complicates any interpretation of the study’s findings.","",""

The authors used a triple difference estimator including state, year, and subgroup variables. The primary data source was U.S. Census data from 1940 to 1960.
The study found that sex-related equal pay laws had negative, statistically significant effects on women’s employment relative to men and a growing positive effect on women’s earnings relative to men over time. Racial discrimination laws had no significant immediate effects on employment or earnings for African American men compared with white men in the short term, but there were positive effects after the laws were in effect for a number of years.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects were attributable to the state sex and race discrimination laws; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Many states passed their own antidiscrimination laws before the federal Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Most prohibited unequal pay for women and employment and wage discrimination based on race.","This study examined the effect of state-level sex and race discrimination laws passed before 1960 on the employment and earnings of protected groups. The authors examined U.S. Census data from 1940 to 1960 for people in all states except Alaska and Hawaii. Theyconsidered adults ages 18 to 70 who identified as African American or Caucasian and who were full-time, full-year workers. The sample excluded people in the armed forces, self-employed workers, unpaid workers, and agricultural and household workers. The study estimated state-level impacts, using the variation in discrimination laws across states to create treatment and comparison groups. Impacts for a protected demographic group were defined as the difference in that group’s change in outcomes relative to another demographic group between states with sex and race discrimination laws and states without such laws.","The study found that sex-related equal pay laws had statistically significant negative effects on women’s employment relative to men’s. African American women experienced a significant 6.9 percentage point reduction in employment relative to African American men; white women had a significant 2.6 percentage point reduction in employment relative to white men.
Analysis of the effect of sex-related equal pay laws over time showed an initial, statistically significant negative impact on earnings for women, but a significant positive impact in the longer-term.
There were no statistically significant effects of race discrimination laws on employment or earnings for African American men compared with white men in the year a law was passed, but positive effects emerged over time.","Although the authors controlled for differences in outcomes associated with each state and each year, as well as basic demographic characteristics and interactions between these factors, they did not examine or control for different trends in outcomes for the groups being compared in the years leading up to passage of the laws in each state. Differences in pre-intervention trends in employment, for example, could have driven differences in employment following the intervention, and could also potentially have affected the timing of the law change by state legislatures. Because of these issues, the study did not demonstrate that the experiences of the comparison group presented a valid picture of what would have happened to the treatment groups if the legislation had not been enacted.","",""

The study used a randomized controlled trial to compare the outcomes of children in households assigned to participate in the program to outcomes of those who did not participate.
The study found a significant relationship between being selected for the BDH program and whether children worked and hours per week children worked; both were significantly lower for those in the treatment group than those in the control group. The study also found that children selected into the BDH program had significantly higher rates of school enrollment and significantly lower rates of having dropped out since the program began.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because it is a randomized controlled trial with unknown attrition and the authors did not ensure that the groups being compared were similar before the intervention. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Bono de Desarrollo Humano program; other factors are likely to have contributed.","Absence of Conflict of Interest.","The Bono de Desarrollo Humano (BDH) program was adapted from the Bono Solidario program, which was previously implemented. Like its predecessor, BDH was implemented in Ecuador to address a low rate of enrollment in secondary schooling. Although both programs aimed to serve poor households, the selection process for BDH was based on a wealth index to better select the target population. BDH was an unconditional cash transfer program, in which women received $15 monthly transfers for their household. While there were no conditions to receive the cash transfers, some of the local households thought that children were required to be enrolled in school because program administrators and television advertisements encouraged school enrollment when discussing the program. The program was also funded by the government, and included four provinces: Carchi, Imbabura, Cotopaxi, and Tungurahua. To be eligible to participate, households needed to have not previously received BDH or Bono Solidario transfers and be in the lowest 40 percent of wealth. The report did not specify whether having a child of a certain age was required to receive the transfers, but the analyses only included households with children ages 6-17.","The study used a randomized controlled trial design to test program impact. Parishes were randomly selected from the provinces, and then a total of 1,391 households were selected from those parishes to be randomized into the treatment and control group. The exact household sampling process was not described, however, the report said that households needed to be in the lowest 40 percent of wealth, that those close to the cut-off between the lowest and second lowest fifth of wealth were overrepresented, and that those selected had not previously received BDH or Bono Solidario transfers. Among the 1,391 households selected for the study, there was a total of 3,072 children. Of those households, half were randomly assigned to the treatment group and the others were randomly assigned to the control group. Households in the control group did not receive transfers or other benefits, but would potentially be able to receive the transfers after two years. However, some control households ended up receiving treatment benefits despite being in the control group. This may have occurred because some program administrators began giving out transfers before they had obtained the list of which households were selected, and did not want to discontinue giving out transfers to households who had already received them.
Two surveys were administered to households: a baseline survey given prior to start of the treatment that assessed child and household demographics and child labor and schooling outcomes (e.g., school enrollment, work participation), and a follow-up survey administered about a year and half afterwards that assessed child schooling and labor outcomes. The authors also used bank records to verify the receipt of transfers. The impact of the program was evaluated by assessing the difference in child labor and schooling outcomes between the treatment and control groups, controlling for baseline differences between the groups. The regression model included the relevant outcome variable (school enrollment or whether the child was working), along with household and child demographic characteristics, and the household’s canton (geographic area).","Employment/Child labor
The study found a significant relationship between BDH program participation and a reduction in the number of hours worked, the proportion of children working 1.5 years after the program began, and the proportion of children who started working between the baseline and 1.5 year follow-up survey. However, there was no significant relationship between program participation and the proportion of children who stopped working between the baseline and 1.5 year follow-up survey.
Education (School participation/enrollment)
The study found that program participation was significantly related to an increase in school enrollment 1.5 years after the program began and a decrease in school dropout. However, there was no a significant relationship between program participation and the proportion of children who enrolled in school between the baseline and follow-up survey.","While the study was a randomized controlled trial, the level of differential attrition was not reported. In addition, baseline equivalence could not be affirmed; while some outcome variables were controlled for in their respective analyses (e.g., enrolled in school, working); for some, that was not the case (e.g., hours worked). In addition, there was a high proportion of those in the control group who received the cash transfers and also a high proportion of those in the treatment group who did not receive the cash transfers, even though they were assigned to that group.","",""

The authors randomly assigned about 8,000 adults and dislocated workers from eight workforce investment agencies across the United States to three ITA approaches: structured customer choice, maximum customer choice, or guided customer choice. The authors analyzed data from Unemployment Insurance (UI) records and from a survey conducted on a random subsample of study participants.
The study found the customers in the structured customer choice approach received significantly higher amounts of public assistance benefits than did customers in the guided customer choice group. The study also found that the structured customer choice group had higher earnings and lower education and training compared with the maximum customer choice group, whereas the maximum customer choice group had lower earnings and higher public assistance benefits compared with the guided customer choice group.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is high because it is based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to differences in the ITA approaches, and not to other factors.","","The study examined dislocated workers and other adults who were new customers of the participating Workforce Investment Area (WIA) agencies who were eligible for ITAs. WIAs have flexibility in how they implement ITAs, which customers use to fund training programs of their choice from a wide selection of state-approved providers. The ITA experiment tested three alternative ways to manage customers’ choices of training programs: structured customer choice, guided customer choice, and maximum customer choice.
Dislocated workers and adults (18 years of age and older) eligible for WIA training assigned to the structured customer choice group received intensive, mandatory weekly counseling. Counselors directed clients to training selections that maximized return on investment and could reject clients’ choices that did not do so. Workers in this condition could also use an ITA to cover the full cost of training (up to $8,000). Those assigned to the guided customer choice group received less intensive but still mandatory weekly counseling that guided them to appropriate training selections. Counselors could not reject clients’ choices under this condition. Those in the guided customer choice group also received a fixed ITA established for their area ($3,000 to $5,000). Those assigned to the maximum customer choice group did not automatically receive, but could request, counseling to guide them to appropriate training selections and received a fixed ITA established for their area ($3,000 to $5,000). Under each condition, regional workforce boards and human services departments provided program services.","To be eligible, customers had to be determined as in need of training, have the skills and qualifications to complete training, have received at least one core and one intensive service, be unable to obtain funding assistance to pay for training from other sources, and consent to participate in the study. About 8,000 dislocated workers and adults eligible for WIA-funded training were randomly assigned to one of three tested ITA approaches. Randomization occurred individually by study staff on a rolling basis as site staff submitted the names of eligible customers. Intake occurred during an approximately 18-month period from December 2001 to August 2002, depending on the site. Follow-up continued for 15 months after random assignment. The authors estimated site-specific impacts using regression models that included site, group assignment dummy variables interacted with site, and baseline characteristics.","The study found that customers in the structured customer choice approach reported receiving significantly more Food Stamps, receiving an average of $78 more during the follow-up period than did customers in the guided customer choice approach ($374 versus $296). This finding was significant at the 5 percent level.
Customers in the structured customer choice approach reported significantly higher earnings, with an average of $1,571 more during the follow-up period than customers in the maximum customer choice approach ($16,685 versus $15,514). This finding was significant at the 5 percent level.
Customers in the structured customer choice approach were significantly less likely to complete a training program during the 15-month follow-up period compared with customers in the maximum customer choice approach (39 versus 43 percent). This finding was significant at the 5 percent level.
Based on administrative records, customers in the maximum customer choice approach had significantly lower earnings, with an average of $1,206 less during the follow-up period than customers in the guided customer choice approach ($14,225 versus $15,431). This finding was significant at the 5 percent level.
Based on the administrative records, customers in the maximum customer choice approach received significantly more UI benefits, with an average of $217 more during the 15-month follow-up period than guided customer choice customers ($3,483 versus $3,266). This finding was significant at the 5 percent level.
Customers in the maximum customer choice approach reported receiving significantly more Food Stamps, with an average of $95 more during the follow-up period than customers in the guided customer choice approach ($391 versus $296). This finding was significant at the 5 percent level.","The study authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to short-term benefit receipt. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not report that they performed statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.
The authors also noted that the structured customer choice approach was generally not implemented as planned. Specifically, counselors were rarely directive with customers, vetoed unauthorized training choices, and did not push customers toward low-cost, high-return training. This could have weakened the contrast between the services received by the treatment and control groups.","Phoenix, Arizona

Services offered by the VWII participants varied, but could consist of benefits screening, explanations of work incentives, and case management.
The studies used earnings data collected from the Vermont Department of Employment and Training. The treatment groups received VWII services and possibly other VR services, whereas the comparison groups received VR services excluding benefits counseling services. The quasi-experimental evaluation employed matched comparison groups and measured impacts using a mixed-effects linear model.
VWII was correlated with significant increases in mean earnings for the treatment group—averaging about $1,250 per year among participants with psychiatric disabilities and about $760 to $900 per year among all participants.
These studies receive a low causal evidence rating because they did not adequately demonstrate baseline equivalence between the treatment and comparison groups or control in the analysis for key factors. A low causal evidence rating means that we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the VWII and other factors likely played a role.","","VWII began in 1999 and provides specialized benefits counseling to Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit recipients who are also receiving VR services. The intensity and duration of the counseling services provided varies, but the services generally consist of benefits screening (researching the recipient’s current benefits status and potential employment issues); providing information about how employment would affect the recipient’s benefits and available work incentives; and assistance in developing a benefits management plan.
The studies evaluated the VWII’s first three years—from 1999 to 2002. The 2004 study examined outcomes among all VWII participants, whereas the 2006 study focused exclusively on outcomes for VWII participants with psychiatric disabilities. For each study, the treatment group consisted of SSDI or SSI benefit recipients who received VWII services and potentially other VR services, whereas the comparison group consisted of SSDI or SSI benefit recipients who received VR services excluding benefits counseling services—that is, they received no VWII services. All study participants were between the ages of 18 and 60 and actively looking for work. According to VR, approximately 48 percent of VWII study participants had a psychiatric condition as their primary disability.","To implement their quasi-experimental evaluations, each study’s authors constructed two matched comparison groups. One comparison group—the “contemporaneous” comparison group—consisted of the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation clients with DVR enrollment dates closest to their matched treatment group members. The other comparison group—referred to as the “historical” comparison group—had DVR enrollment dates that were approximately 2.5 years earlier than those of the treatment group. Each treatment group member was matched to one person from each comparison group pool. The matching variables included (1) experience as a DVR client, (2) experience as a Social Security disability benefit recipient while a DVR client, (3) primary disabling condition according to the DVR, (4) start date of DVR services, and (5) length of time since becoming eligible and starting DVR services. For both studies, the authors estimated impacts using mixed-effects linear models.
The studies used data from two sources. Quarterly earnings data for study participants were from the Vermont Department of Employment and Training. All other data were from the DVR. The studies’ outcome variable was earnings from competitive employment.","2006 study. Among participants with psychiatric disabilities, VWII participation was correlated with significant increases in mean earnings. Treatment group members increased their earnings by $1,256 per person per year relative to the contemporaneous comparison group and $1,272 per person per year relative to the historical comparison group.
2004 study. Among all study participants, VWII participation was linked to earnings increases. Treatment group members increased their earnings by $900 and $760 per person per year relative to the contemporaneous and historical comparison groups, respectively.","The authors mention that an SSI waiver program, which provided additional work incentives to SSI recipients, started during the intervention period and was only available to people who received benefits counseling—that is, treatment group members. Thus, for all SSI recipients who participated in the program, the study measured the effect of benefits counseling plus the SSI waiver.
In addition, the earnings data were drawn from the Vermont unemployment insurance records, and therefore do not include income obtained from self-employment, out-of-state work, elected office, religious nonprofit organizations, charitable and educational organizations, farm work, and some railroad work. The authors estimate that about 11 percent of study participants received earnings from sources not reported in state unemployment insurance records. Hence, the analyses’ dependent variable may contain substantial measurement error. Finally, the ethnic homogeneity of Vermont's population may limit the ability to generalize the study’s results to other states.","VR offices and community mental health centers throughout Vermont.",""

The authors used administrative records to estimate the impact of the drug court by comparing the outcomes of youth who participated in the drug court with those of similar youth who did not.
The study found that drug court participants had significantly fewer rearrests (36 percent fewer) and fewer days (59 percent fewer) on probation than youth who were eligible for the program but did not participate. Participants spent fewer days in secure and community detention in the first year after program entry than youth in the comparison group. However, the study found no significant effects on the number of adjudication hearings, days in residential treatment, or days in a group home.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it was based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Harford County Juvenile Drug Court, but other factors might also have contributed.","","The Harford County Juvenile Drug Court opened in 2000 as an unfunded pilot project to address a serious drug problem in Harford County. The drug court applied for and received a federal grant through the U. S. Department of Justice Drug Court Program in September 2001 and began operation in October 2001. In 2001, the researchers (NPC Research) contracted with the Administrative Office of the Courts of the State of Maryland to evaluate the Harford County Juvenile Drug Court. The drug court served juveniles “who were heavily involved with drugs and the juvenile justice system, had a significant prior treatment experience and were repeat offenders.”
The program aimed for its members to abstain from drugs and alcohol, have no further arrests, achieve in school, improve relationships with family, secure and maintain employment, understand addiction and its consequences, learn how to make healthy decisions, set goals related to drug court and seek and secure appropriate assistance to meet them, maintain self-discipline and responsible behavior, and develop and maintain an interest in a new support group.
The program had three 90-day phases, each of which had its own treatment and probation requirements. Parents and guardians attended the first session and gave consent for their children’s participation.","The authors used administrative data to identify 96 drug court participants from 2001 to 2004. They matched those youth with a comparison group of 99 youth who had not participated in the drug court; were residents of Harford County; had a similar number of prior complaints; and, at the start date, were of similar age, race or ethnicity, and gender as drug court participants. The authors showed that the drug court participants and comparison group youth did not differ significantly on these characteristics. The authors estimated the impact of the drug court by comparing the recidivism outcomes of drug court participants with those of comparison group youth.","The study found that drug court participants had significantly fewer rearrests (36 percent fewer) and fewer days (59 percent fewer) on probation than youth in the comparison group in the two years after program entry.
Drug court participants spent fewer days in secure and community detention in the first year after program entry than youth in the comparison group.
The study found no significant effect of drug court participation on the number of adjudication hearings, days in residential treatment, or days in a group home.","Although the study highlighted select findings that achieved statistical significance, of the five measures of new arrests examined, only one differed significantly between the drug court and comparison group. Specifically, the study reported significant effects on a combined measure of juvenile and adult rearrests two years after program entry, but found no significant effects one year following program entry, nor for measures that separated juvenile and adult rearrests. Of the 10 measures of new criminal or juvenile sentences, only 3 indicated statistically significant differences between the drug court and comparison group youth. Similarly, the estimated effects of the program on days in secure or community detention were statistically significant in the first year after program entry, but not at the two-year follow-up. The sensitivity of the findings to the measure construction and follow-up period suggests caution must be taken in interpreting the results.","",""

The study found that members of the treatment group produced significantly more wealth-creating ideas and developed more ideas based on occupational experience than members of the control group.

Participants in both groups were offered a series of seven 45- to 60-minute sessions over a period of eight weeks. The first six sessions, held once per week in the first six weeks, focused on training. Participants in the treatment group received training in systematic search that directed them to use constrained and focused thinking in developing business ideas. Participants in the control group were directed to remain alert to business ideas that might emerge over the course of their customary activities, but did not receive systematic search training. The two training courses followed similar structures and differed only in their content.
Throughout the program, participants in both groups recorded business ideas in journals that the authors used as data in the analysis, including a description of the idea, how it was developed and in what context, and its value. The final session served as a debriefing in which the authors discussed the data they had collected over the previous six sessions.","The study found that the treatment group generated 25 percent more wealth-creating ideas than the control group, a statistically significant finding.

To receive a moderate causal evidence rating, studies must either establish the equivalence of the two groups being analyzed on their background characteristics or control for those characteristics in the analysis. In this study, the authors neither investigated differences between the treatment and control groups’ racial compositions nor controlled for race in their analysis of the number of wealth-creating ideas. The analysis of ideas emerging from occupational experience included no statistical controls.

The author administered a survey of his own design before and after respondents participated in an SBDC seminar and compared the respondents’ pre- and post-seminar responses on a series of items measuring intentions to start a business.
The study found no statistically significant relationships between participation in the SBDC seminar and intentions to start a business.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the author did not account for pre-intervention trends in participants’ entrepreneurial intentions. This means that we would not be confident that any estimated effects would be attributable to the SBDC seminar; however, the study found no effects.","","","The author investigated the effect of attending a business counseling seminar on participants’ interest in starting a business. The free seminar, offered at multiple locations through Illinois’ network of SBDCs, typically lasted two to three hours. Seminar topics included launching a business, relevant legal issues, business planning, and financing.
The author selected a sample of SBDC sites in the study using a stratified sampling design. One SBDC site was selected in each region with the exception of the Northeast region, where two SBDCs were selected. Site selection was based on the maturity of the business counseling program, recommendations from the state SBDC director, and the local SBDC director’s willingness to participate. Study participants attended a pre-counseling seminar within a four-month period, consented to participate in the study, and completed both the pre- and post- seminar surveys, for a total analytic sample size of 310 (about 30 participants per site). The author compared participants’ intentions to start a business before and after they attended the SBDC seminar.","The study found no statistically significant relationships between participation in the SBDC seminar and intentions to start a business.","The author compared participants’ intentions to start a business measured once before and after they participated in an SBDC seminar. CLEAR’s guidelines require that authors observe outcomes for multiple periods before the intervention to rule out the possibility that participants’ outcomes were already increasing or decreasing before taking part in the program. In this context, if participants whose interest in and disposition toward entrepreneurship were increasing tended to attend the SBDC seminar, we would anticipate further improvements in their intent to start a business over time, regardless of the seminar’s effects. In the absence of evidence regarding pre-intervention trends, we cannot confidently separate the program’s effect from the effects of such trends.","",""

The author examined Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO-4) State and Local Government Report data from 1973 to 1999 for 314 major U.S. cities. The author also examined additional data covering 1960 to 1973 for 120 cities, collected from a variety of historical sources. 
The study found that the difference in the African American representation gap between litigated and unlitigated cities diminished and almost completely disappeared by 1999.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is low because the author did not control for pre-existing differences between unlitigated and litigated cities. This means that we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to hiring discrimination litigation. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, employers are forbidden from discriminating against their employees on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, or national origin. Title VII created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to bring class action litigation against employers for discrimination. The EEOC and the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) work together to enforce Title VII compliance of state and local governmental employers, including police and fire departments, as the DOJ has the authority to sue such employers for Title VII violations. Private litigants may also bring charges.
Starting in 1969, a large number of class action employment discrimination lawsuits were filed in federal district courts. Successful lawsuits often ordered race-based hiring quotas for the defendants; these quotas were usually imposed after one to three years and could potentially last for many years. Hiring quotas could be withdrawn judicially—for instance, if a new and nondiscriminatory hiring examination satisfying the court was developed. Alternatively, hiring quotas could expire when the court’s conditions were met; for example, the court might require that the department’s workforce attain a certain African American employment share.","This study examined claims of hiring discrimination brought by private individuals or by the DOJ against municipal police or fire departments. The author investigated whether the filing of such litigation reduced these departments’ African American representation gaps, defined as the difference between a department’s African American employment share and the percentage of African Americans in the surrounding area. The author used a regression model to compare the representation gaps of cities that did and did not ever face litigation for hiring discrimination from 1973 to 1999, controlling for fixed city- and region-by-year effects. The model estimated the effects of litigation during the year filed and for each year afterward. Data on police and fire department employment and demographics came from EEO-4 State and Local Government Report files, which are surveys conducted by the EEOC. The full sample included 314 cities that had among the largest municipal police and fire departments on average over the sample period, about 30 percent of which ever faced litigation during the sample period. The author examined a longer period from 1960 to 1999 for a subsample of 120 cities, using data collected from a variety of historical sources.","The study found that the difference in the African American representation gap between cities that did and did not ever face hiring discrimination litigation against their police or fire departments during the sample period diminished and almost completely disappeared by 1999.
Across all 314 cities included in the sample, African Americans made a statistically significant gain of 10 percentage points of employment share of police and fire departments over 25 years.","The author showed that pre-enforcement trends in the representation gap were not similar in litigated and unlitigated cities, with the gap widening in litigated cities in the years before the litigation. Characteristics of litigated and unlitigated cities differed, with litigated cities having a larger African American population share. Because of the lack of similarity between the cities before some of them engaged in litigation, the estimated impact might reflect not only any effect of the litigation, but also changes in discrimination related to preexisting differences between the cities. In addition, enforcement efforts might have targeted police and fire departments with more discriminatory practices, making it difficult to disentangle the effect of litigation on discrimination from the effect of discrimination on litigation. For these reasons, the findings might not reflect the effect of hiring discrimination litigation alone.","",""

The study was a randomized controlled trial that compared the outcomes of treatment and control groups over three semesters. The primary data sources were students’ transcripts from the colleges and a baseline survey on students’ background characteristics.
The study found that students who participated in the Opening Doors program attempted and passed a greater number of courses, registered for and earned more credits, and were enrolled for more semesters than students in the control group.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Louisiana Opening Doors program, and not to other factors.","","The Opening Doors program provided students at Delgado Community College (City Park and West Bank Campuses) and Louisiana Technical College (West Jefferson Campus) with a $1,000 scholarship for each of two semesters if they enrolled at least half-time and earned at least a C average (a 2.0 grade point average). The scholarships were paid out over the course of each semester to ensure that the students adhered to program guidelines. In addition to the scholarships, program participants received enhanced counseling designed to help them address problems that might have prevented continuation of schooling. Eligible students were those who (1) were ages 18 to 34, (2) were parents of at least one dependent child younger than 19, (3) had a family income below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, (4) had a high school diploma or general equivalency degree (GED) certificate and a passing score on a college entrance exam, and (5) had no degree or occupational certificate from an accredited college or university.","This study was a randomized controlled trial in which the authors followed students’ progress over three semesters. The authors applied two-tailed t-tests to regression-adjusted differences between treatment and control groups to estimate the impact of the Opening Doors program on the number of courses attempted and passed, number of credits that students registered for and earned, course withdrawal rate, and number of semesters enrolled. The primary data sources were students’ transcripts from the colleges and a baseline survey on students’ background characteristics. This study examined outcomes in 2004 and 2005, before Hurricane Katrina.","The study found that Opening Doors students registered for any courses at a significantly higher rate than control students in their second and third semesters, and were enrolled for a significantly higher number of semesters overall.
Opening Doors students attempted a significantly higher number of courses than control students in their second and third semesters and passed a significantly higher number of courses in their first, second, and third semesters.
Opening Doors students registered for and earned a significantly higher number of credits than control students in their first, second, and third semesters, and they earned a significantly higher number of credits overall. They earned a significantly higher number of regular credits in their first, second, and third semesters, and a significantly higher number of developmental credits in their second semester than control students.","The study authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to students’ progress toward degree completion. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","",""

The Fort Worth site was one of three in Texas that participated in the Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) project.
The authors randomly assigned about 1,200 single-parent participants in Fort Worth’s Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program to either a treatment group, which received ERA services, or a control group, which received standard TANF services. The authors analyzed data from Unemployment Insurance (UI), TANF, and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) administrative records.
The study found that treatment group members were 6.1 percentage points more likely to have been employed at any time in the second year after random assignment than those in the control group. Treatment group members were also 4.2 percentage points more likely to be employed during the last quarter of that second year.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the ERA program, and not to other factors.","","The ERA project was introduced in 1999 as a nationwide exploration of factors that help welfare recipients not only find employment but retain their positions and advance in their careers. Fort Worth was one of 16 sites across the United States to receive funding from the Department of Health and Human Services to implement a program intended to improve welfare recipients’ employment outcomes. (Two other sites in Texas were evaluated separately and are therefore reported separately by CLEAR.)
TANF recipients assigned to the Texas ERA program attended an initial orientation and then a four-day job-search workshop. They then spent four to six weeks searching for jobs. The program assigned those who did not then secure employment to community service or volunteer positions. People who found jobs were eligible for a $200 monthly stipend for up to 12 months if they were employed for at least 30 hours per week, participated in a post-employment “advancement” activity, or left TANF; they could also receive the stipend if they worked 15 hours per week and participated in an education and training activity. The first 4 months of earnings for people in the program were disregarded when calculating their eligibility for the stipend. Texas ERA staff also helped clients with job-related problems, reemployment assistance, and support in meeting stipend requirements. Program staff made regular employer site visits. Participants were eligible for these services as long as they were eligible for the monthly stipend. Program staff coordinated case management services (including employment assessment, goal setting and career planning, support services, barrier resolution, and job-search assistance) across several partner agencies.","From November 2000 through December 2002, 1,564 single-parent participants were randomly assigned to the ERA program or Choices program (control group) after TANF eligibility had been confirmed, but before receiving cash assistance (the final report indicates that 1,572 participants were randomly assigned through January 2003). Participants assigned to the ERA program attended a TANF orientation. They then received cash assistance and began participating in ERA activities. Participation in both the ERA and Choices conditions was mandatory for 75 percent of those randomly assigned. Participants from two-parent families were also randomly assigned, but, with too few two-parent families to report separately on their outcomes, the report excluded them from the analysis.
The authors focused on single-parent participants who were randomly assigned from October 2000 through June 2002 in Fort Worth (the report included contradictory information on what month random assignment began). The analytic sample of 1,164 participants represented about 74 percent of the sample randomly assigned for Fort Worth.","The study found that treatment group members were 6.1 percentage points more likely to have been employed at any time in the second year after random assignment than those in the control group.
Treatment group members were also 4.2 percentage points more likely to be employed during the last quarter of the second post-intervention year. These impacts were significant at the 5 percent level.","The authors noted that the study compared an experimental program with a long-established, well-developed existing welfare system—Texas Choices—that strengthened and expanded over the course of the study. This could have weakened the contrast between the services received by the treatment and control groups.","",""

The authors assessed factors affecting diversification in 401(k) plans through four studies. The first was an interrupted time series analysis of employer stock holdings at an unnamed company. The other three studies explored the impact of media attention to the Enron, WorldCom, and Global Crossing bankruptcies through regression analysis. All analyses were based on transaction-level and annual data from 1997 to 2003 from Hewitt Associates, a benefits administration company.

The authors established three treatment groups based on the level of WIA services used and matched them to three comparison groups that participated in Employment Services (ES) and/or the core WIA services.
The study found that the employment rate and average quarterly earnings were significantly higher for those in each of the treatment groups compared with their matched comparison groups. Benefits receipt was also significantly lower for those in the treatment groups than in their comparison groups.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not ensure that the groups being compared were similar before program participation. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the WIA Adult Program; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The WIA Adult Program was authorized by Title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 and was superseded by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), effective in July 2015. The Adult Program services, which remained essentially the same under WIOA, were designed to provide quality employment and training services to eligible workers. Administered through local workforce investment areas, the Adult Program served all people ages 18 years and older through core services; these included job placement assistance, skills assessments, and provision of information on the labor market, among other services. In addition, those unable to obtain a job through core services alone could receive intensive services—which included counseling and specialized assessments—and vouchers for attending training. Recipients of public assistance and other low-income people received priority for intensive and training services in local workforce investment areas in which program funds were limited. In addition, some local areas provided supportive services such as child care, transportation, and work-related financial assistance to those who qualified.","The study included a sample of workers who received core, training, or intensive services through the WIA Adult Program from among 92,787 workers who received services from either the WIA Adult or WIA Dislocated Worker programs. These workers were ages 22 to 64 and exited the program from July 2000 to June 2002 and were observed for up to eight quarters after program exit. Their earnings were also below the top 0.5 percent of all earners in all quarters of the study period.
The authors used administrative data sources, including WIA Standardized Record Data, ES and Unemployment Insurance records, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) records from each state to compare the number of quarters employed, quarterly earnings, and months of receipt of TANF benefits of WIA participants with those of the ES participants who exited the program at the same time.
The authors established three treatment groups based on the level of WIA services used: (1) workers who received any of the employment-related services available through the WIA Adult Program, (2) workers who received the training services available through the WIA Adult Program, and (3) workers who received the intensive or training services available through the WIA Adult Program. The respective three comparison groups were (1) workers who participated in the ES program, (2) WIA Adult Program participants who did not receive the available training services, and (3) ES participants combined with workers who received only core services available through the WIA Adult Program.","Employment. The percentage of quarters employed after program exit was significantly higher for those who took part in WIA Adult Program services compared with those in the comparison group, with estimates across the three contrasts ranging from 4.4 to 8.7 percentage points.
Earnings. Average quarterly earnings were significantly higher for those who took part in WIA Adult Program services compared with those in the comparison group, with estimates across the three contrasts ranging from $669 to $764.
Benefits receipt. Those who took part in WIA Adult Program services received TANF benefits for a significantly lower percentage of months after program exit compared with those in the comparison group, with estimates across the three contrasts ranging from 1.5 to 2.6 percentage points.","Although the authors accounted for many underlying characteristics of the groups being compared, which could also influence their outcomes, the authors’ decision to define the groups based on their date of program exit rather than program entry is problematic. For example, suppose that the WIA and ES participants were on identical wage trajectories before receiving services from their respective programs and that the average length of participation in WIA services was six months, whereas that for Employment Services was one month. At the conclusion of participation, they exited the program.
If we compared the groups’ earnings 6 months after their recorded exit dates, we would observe WIA participants’ earnings about 12 months after they started receiving services and ES participants’ earnings about 7 months after they started receiving services. If both programs were completely ineffective, and everyone stayed on their original upward-sloping wage trajectory, it would appear as though the WIA participants earned more 6 months after their exit dates. However, this would not be attributable to receiving WIA services; it would have been caused by the different elapsed time across the groups (12 months for WIA participants versus 7 months for ES participants). Therefore, studies defining the groups based on exit date, rather than entry date, cannot receive a moderate causal evidence rating. This would also be true when comparing employment rates, earnings, and benefits receipt.","The study used administrative data from the following states:

The study was a randomized controlled trial that used data from administrative records to compare outcomes between treatment and control group members from one to five years after random assignment.
The study found that residents in the Jobs-Plus housing developments had higher long-term earnings than residents in the control group developments.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Jobs-Plus program and not to other factors.","","Jobs-Plus was an employment and training program with three core components: employment-related services and activities, including job search skills, soft skills training, vocational training, education and training, and child care and transportation assistance; financial incentives to work; and community support for work. For the evaluation, Jobs-Plus was implemented in selected housing developments in six U.S. cities from 1998 through 1999.","The authors used a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the Jobs-Plus program. They selected cities based on a national competition, and housing authorities had to have at least two large developments that met the study criteria to qualify for the study. The authors randomly assigned housing developments to a condition when the program launched in 1998. Each city had a matched cluster of two or three similar housing developments; one housing development implemented Jobs-Plus and the other one or two housing developments represented the comparison condition. (The authors treated comparison housing developments as a business-as-usual condition with no Jobs-Plus services.) The impact analysis focused on people 21 to 61 years old who were not identified by the housing authority as people with disabilities. The authors obtained data for up to six years before and six years after implementation of Jobs-Plus. The evaluation included 15 housing developments in six cities with a total of 4,774 residents.","The study found that residents in the Jobs-Plus housing developments had significantly higher average annual earnings than control group residents five years after program implementation ($8,578 compared to $8,106).","The implementation of the Jobs-Plus program was slow, and many residents left the housing developments during the program rollout from 1998 through 1999.

The study was a randomized controlled trial that compared outcomes for the intervention and control groups over 16 weeks. The CWT program’s clinical and financial records were used to assess employment and wage outcomes. Urine screens and participant reports were used to measure substance use outcomes.
The study found that total wages for the enhanced incentives group were significantly higher than for the control group. The study also found that the intervention group abstained from substance use for a significantly longer time than the control group.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low for the employment and earnings outcomes because the authors did not establish that the intervention and control groups were equivalent one year before the intervention in terms of earnings or employment. This means we are not confident the estimated effects on these outcomes are attributable to the enhanced incentives in the CWT program; other factors are likely to have contributed.","Absence of conflict of interest.","","The study was a randomized controlled trial that examined the effects of an enhanced incentives program incorporated into an existing VA CWT program at the Bedford VA Medical Center. Dually diagnosed veterans younger than age 55 who had had competitive employment in the past 3 years and more than 10 years of education were eligible for the study. A dual diagnosis was defined as those with current drug or alcohol dependence and either a diagnosis of schizophrenia; major depression; or posttraumatic stress, bipolar, or other anxiety disorder. Veterans with a history of significant head trauma were excluded from the study.
The intervention group received financial incentives for completing job search activities and for abstaining from drugs and alcohol. Job search incentives were awarded for creating a resume and attending a job interview. Participants received additional incentives for consecutive weeks of competitive employment, with increasing payments for each additional consecutive week of competitive work. Participants also received monetary incentives for passing drug and alcohol screens throughout the study period. Incentives increased for each consecutive week the screen showed no drug or alcohol use. To be eligible to earn any of these incentives, individuals in the intervention group were required to maintain enrollment in CWT. This means individuals were indirectly incentivized to participate in CWT activities and meetings. In total, participants could earn up to $1,006 for completing all of the activities during the 16-week period. The control group participated in the CWT program without enhanced incentives.
The study included 19 eligible participants. The OnTrak TestCup 5 and the OnSite Alcohol Assay (Roche Diagnostics Inc.) urine screens as well as participant reports were used for the drug and alcohol screen. The CWT program’s clinical and financial records were used to assess employment and wages. Pay stubs, or other similar work documentation, were used to determine competitive work and related durations and hours. The authors used a statistical model to compare the outcomes of intervention and control group members.
The study also examined job search intensity, measured by the Job Search Behaviors Scale. This outcome is not a focus of the review.","Employment
The study found no statistically significant relationship between the intervention and weeks or hours of competitive employment.
Earnings
Receiving enhanced incentives during the course of the CWT program was associated with significantly higher wages over the course of the 16-week period ($4,701 for the intervention group versus $2,796 for the control group).
Health
The study found that the intervention group abstained from substance use for a significantly longer time than the control group.","As noted by the authors, the sample size of the study was very small.
The employment and wage outcomes received a low rating because the randomized controlled trial had high attrition and the authors did not show that the intervention and control groups were equivalent one year before the intervention for these two measures. If individuals typically enter training programs after a period of especially poor employment outcomes, even in the absence of a training program, outcomes would probably improve over time. Without knowing study participants’ employment status or wages one year or more before the intervention, we cannot rule this out.","",""

The CET program provided an intensive, short-term job training program for economically disadvantaged out-of-school youth that was designed to mirror the workplace.
The overall impact of CET on youths’ employment outcomes is described in a different report (see CLEAR profile of Miller et al. 2005). This report described whether three barriers to employment—(1) lack of a high school diploma or general education development (GED) certificate, (2) childbearing, and (3) arrests—were associated with lower employment rates, and whether lower employment rates stemmed from employment instability or a longer length of time needed to find a job.
The authors used data from the 54-month survey of CET applicants from the impact evaluation. For that evaluation, eligible youth were randomly assigned to receive CET services or to the control group, which was ineligible for CET services.
The authors found that youth who did not finish high school or obtain a GED were less successful in the labor market than those who received a high school credential. Wages for dropouts were lower on average and dropouts worked less than high school graduates and GED recipients. Among male dropouts, job instability contributed to low average employment rates; for female dropouts, both job instability and longer spells of unemployment contributed to low employment rates.
Having children at study entry was not associated with poorer employment outcomes for males or females. However, young men who had arrest records faced substantial challenges in finding jobs and were more likely to work in lower quality jobs in the retail or service industries than those without arrest records.","","","","","","",""

The study used a regression model to compare the changes in workplace injuries of manufacturing firms that had received an inspection that resulted in a penalty or citation to those that had not received a penalty or citation. The group of firms that had not received a penalty or citation combined two types of firms: firms that had not been inspected and firms that received inspections that did not result in a penalty or citation.
The study found that OSHA inspections that resulted in a penalty were associated with statistically significant decreases in lost-workday injuries. Among the specific citations studied, citations for the standards for general requirements for personal protective equipment and general machine guarding were associated with statistically significant reductions in some types of lost-workday injuries.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this study is low. This means we are not confident that OSHA inspections that resulted in penalties or citations caused the reductions in workplace injuries.","","The study examined the effects of OSHA inspections that resulted in a penalty or citation at any time in the past four years on the rates of different types of workplace injuries that resulted in an employee taking one or more days away from work. The study also examined the effects of inspections resulting in specific citations, including those related to machine guarding, personal protective equipment, electrical wiring, forklift trucks, and fire extinguishers. Injuries were classified by type and examined based on their relationship to OSHA standards: struck by, caught in, high fall, eye abrasion, and toxic exposure were classified as “related to standards,” and exertion, struck against, and fall same level were classified as “unrelated to standards.”","The study used a regression model to compare the changes in workplace injuries of manufacturing firms that had received an inspection that resulted in a penalty to those that had either not been inspected or had been inspected but had not received a penalty. For the analysis of specific citations, the study used a similar model to compare the changes in workplace injuries in manufacturing firms that had received an inspection that resulted in a citation for a specific type of violation to firms that had either not been inspected or that had received an inspection that did not result in this type of citation. The models included controls for changes in employment, changes in hours, industry, and year. The models did not distinguish between firms that were not inspected and those that were inspected but did not receive a penalty or citation.
The authors used confidential plant-level data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses, as well as inspections data from the OSHA Integrated Management Information System, for 16,036 manufacturing plants in the United States between 1992 and 1998.","OSHA inspections that resulted in a penalty were associated with statistically significant decreases in lost-workday injuries, both for injury types believed to be related to OSHA standards (1.8 percent per year for four years) and for injury types believed to be unrelated to OSHA standards (2.8 percent per year for four years).
Citations for violating the general requirements for personal protective equipment and machine guarding were associated with statistically significant decreases in some types of lost-workday injuries.","In this study, the estimated differences between firms in the changes in injury rates may not be caused by the inspections, penalties, and citations. The differences in injury rates could reflect underlying differences in safety levels or other factors between the firms being compared. For example, about 32 percent of the OSHA inspections from 1990 to 1998 were triggered by a complaint of a workplace hazard. Therefore, the firms that received inspections likely had more underlying workplace hazards, on average, than firms that were not inspected. Similarly, firms that received a penalty or citation likely had more egregious safety violations than those that were inspected and did not receive a penalty or citation. In the absence of inspections, firms with more hazards and safety violations may have experienced different changes in injury rates as conditions deteriorated or because management would have made improvements to address unsafe working conditions.","",""

The FRC was a six-week competition in which teams of high school male and female students (with the help of mentors) used a set of standard parts to build a robot. Students showcased these robots by competing against teams from other high schools.
The authors used propensity-score matching to create treatment and comparison groups and conducted an analysis of retrospective survey data to measure education and career outcomes of FRC participants who graduated from the program from 1999 to 2003. They administered a researcher-designed survey to students in the treatment group in 2004 and collected data from a national survey—the Beginning Postsecondary Student Survey (BPSS)—to measure outcomes for the comparison group, who began college in 1995-1996.
The study found that a higher percentage of female FRC participants majored in engineering compared with females in the comparison group.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not demonstrate equivalency of the treatment and comparison groups on all required measures. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the FRC; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The FRC was a six-week competition in which teams of high school students (with the help of teachers at their school and community mentors) used a set of standard parts to build a robot. Students showcased these robots by competing against teams from other high schools in a variety of challenges at regional and national events. During the program, students were required to attend team meetings, raise funds, build and program the robot, develop a strategy for the competition, and present the robot to various audiences. Typically, teams divided these tasks among the team members so specific work varied by student. Schools across the country were able to form their own FRC team and students self-selected themselves into the teams. The goal of the program was to increase students’ STEM interests and abilities, while also developing teamwork, leadership, and project management skills.","The primary goal of the study was to retrospectively determine the impact of participation in the FRC on a variety of outcomes for all students, but particularly low-income and minority students. To do so, the authors first invited all of the high schools in three large metropolitan areas (New York City, Detroit/Pontiac metropolitan area, and San Jose/San Francisco Bay area) that had been running the FRC program for at least two years to participate in the study. Of the 30 schools invited to participate, 14 had the interest and necessary data to do so. These 14 schools identified 360 former program participants to form the treatment group, of which 173 ultimately filled out the study-administered survey (a 48 percent response rate) and were included in the analysis.
The researchers compared the study-administered survey data collected from the treatment group with the BPSS survey data to create a comparison group using propensity-score matching. Using 147 exact matched pairs—matching on participants’ demographics, parental education, economic status of the high school, and various measures of high school STEM engagement—the authors compared the two groups on a variety of education, career, and developmental outcomes by calculating the difference in average outcome between the treatment and comparison groups and determining the statistical significance.","The study found that a higher percentage of female FRC participants majored in engineering compared with the comparison group (32.6 versus 8.7 percent).
The authors also found a marginally statistically significant difference in the proportion of females majoring in STEM-related fields more generally (in addition to engineering) (41.3 percent of the treatment group compared with 21.7 percent of the comparison group).","This study has several issues that should be considered when interpreting the findings. First, the treatment and comparison groups might differ substantially on both observed and unobserved characteristics. The authors did not match students on age as required for this review, and students could self-select into the intervention, which could bias the results. Second, data for the treatment group came from study-administered surveys of participants who were several years removed from program participation, such that some survey results might be subject to recall bias. Third, the treatment sample might suffer from nonresponse bias because only 14 of 30 treatment schools participated and only 173 of 360 former students responded to the study-administered survey. Fourth, the treatment and comparison groups did not attend college at the same time, and the authors used different data sources to measure their outcomes, both of which could confound the results.","",""

J.A. Croson Co. (referred to as the Croson decision) in 1989, which weakened affirmative action policies, on self-employment, with a focus on the construction industry, by race, ethnicity, and gender.
The study used a nonexperimental analyses to compare self-employment before and after the Croson decision. The authors used national data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the 2000 decennial U.S. Census.
The study found that gender disparities in self-employment rates have declined since the Croson decision in all industries, but have declined most in construction. In contrast, racial and ethnic disparities in self-employment have declined since the Croson decision in all industries except construction.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is low because the authors did not control for trends in self-employment or earnings before the Croson decision. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Croson decision. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","In 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co. This decision instituted more stringent tests for the legitimacy of race- and gender-based affirmative action programs in public contracting. The Croson decision required a “strict scrutiny test” that there was actual discrimination to warrant race-based policies; otherwise, such race-based policies were deemed unconstitutional. Although the Croson decision was specific to Richmond, Virginia, other cities’ race-based affirmative action policies were challenged in court following the Croson decision, with many deemed unconstitutional, including in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Columbus, Ohio; Fulton County, Georgia (Atlanta); Dade County, Florida (Miami); Cook County, Illinois (Chicago); the District of Columbia; and the states of Florida and Ohio. The authors argue that such tests dampen the effects of affirmative action programs on promoting business formation by minorities, proxied in this study by self-employment rates.","This study used a nonexperimental design to examine self-employment rates and earnings in the construction industry and on average across all industries by race, ethnicity, and gender. The analysis included noninstitutionalized men and women ages 16 and older in all states and industries who were either self-employed or employed in the private sector. The authors estimated regression models comparing the outcomes for different race, ethnicity, and gender groups before (1979 to 1991) and after (1992 to 2004) the Croson decision, controlling for age, education, industry, state, and year. The authors used data from the CPS March Annual Demographic files to estimate statistical models of earnings, with additional controls included for occupation. Data from the CPS Merged Outgoing Rotation Group files and the 2000 decennial U.S. Census were used to estimate models of self-employment.","Across all industries, disparities in self-employment rates by race and ethnicity declined somewhat following the Croson decision. However, these disparities changed little in the construction industry following the Croson decision. The authors did not report whether the change before and after the Croson decision was statistically significant.
Disparities in self-employment rates by gender declined following the Croson decision, especially in the construction industry. The authors did not report whether the change before and after the Croson decision was statistically significant.
Disparities in self-employment earnings by race and ethnicity fell in the construction industry after the Croson decision, but increased on average across all industries. In contrast, disparities in self-employment earnings by gender increased in the construction industry, but fell on average across all industries. The authors did not report whether the change before and after the Croson decision was statistically significant.","The authors defined the period before the Croson decision as 1979 to 1991, but the Croson decision occurred in 1989. Thus, some of the effect of the decision might be captured in the last two years of the comparison period as defined by the authors. In addition, the authors did not adequately control for pre-decision trends in self-employment and earnings for the groups being examined; therefore, the estimated effects might reflect pre-existing differences in employment and earnings and not the effect of the court ruling.","",""

The 36 grants issued under this program, which began in 2000 and continued for five years, aimed to expand opportunities for at-risk youth in low-income areas by providing a variety of support services.
The study explored how the grants were implemented, key barriers faced during implementation, and perceptions of the outcomes of the program and its impact on participating youth and their communities.
To answer its research questions, the GAO conducted a survey with 36 Youth Opportunity Grant program directors and seven site visits. The site visits included interviews with program managers and staff, youth participants, and community members; facilities tours; observations of program activities; and collection of management information systems data.
The study found that grantees adopted a variety of approaches to recruiting and serving at-risk youth, often responding to conditions in their local labor markets. However, many faced challenges in rolling out the program within the set time frames; addressing drug use, violence and unemployment in their communities; and adapting their services for youth struggling at school or with problems at home. Many program participants graduated from high school, enrolled in college, or joined the workforce after receiving Youth Opportunity Grant services.
The GAO recommended that the Department of Labor complete the impact analysis of the Youth Opportunity Grant program and release all related reports and data.","","","","","","",""

This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the grants; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Passed in 1991, the Nontraditional Employment for Women (NEW) Act offered states competitive, short-term grants to implement programs that prepare and recruit women for employment in nontraditional occupations. By 1997, 18 states had received funding under NEW, although only 3 states maintained their programs into the 2000s.
In 1992, the Women in Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Occupations (WANTO) Act extended this mission by providing funds to community, union, or employer organizations that offered technical assistance to employers and labor unions to assist them in training, recruiting, and retaining women in nontraditional occupations. More than 50 organizations received funding from WANTO from 1994 to 2001.","The author considered a treated area a region in which a NEW or WANTO grant had been awarded and a comparison area a region in which no such grant had been awarded. One model estimated the impact of the grants on the probability of women’s employment in nontraditional occupations among women alone, with a sample of 185,171 women in treated areas and 370,018 in comparison areas. The author used a difference-in-differences model, comparing the change over time in the probability of employment in a nontraditional occupation for women in treated areas to the change over time for women in comparison areas.
A second model used a triple-difference strategy, differencing the difference-in-differences estimates for men and women (as described previously) to estimate the impact of the programs. The analysis included 382,330 women and men in treated areas and 749,843 women and men in comparison areas.","The study found that the grants were associated with statistically significant increases in the probability of women’s employment in nontraditional occupations. Using the difference-in-differences model, NEW or WANTO grants were associated with a 5 percent increase in the probability of employment in a nontraditional occupation.
Using the triple difference model, NEW or WANTO grants were associated with a 15 percent increase in the probability of employment in a nontraditional occupation.","Although the study controlled for many demographic characteristics of interest, such as race, marital status, and education, there was no evidence that treated and comparison areas experienced similar trends in women’s employment in nontraditional occupations before the award of the NEW and WANTO grants. Likewise, there is no evidence that the difference between women’s and men’s employment in nontraditional occupations changed similarly in treated and comparison areas before award of the grants. Therefore, the results might reflect existing trends in the outcome rather than the effects of the grants.","",""

The study used a regression model to compare the changes in workplace injuries in manufacturing establishments that had received an inspection within the past four years to those in establishments that had not received inspections.
The study found that OSHA inspections were associated with statistically significant reductions in lost-workday injuries of 10 percent in 1979–1985 and 4 percent in 1987–1991, but had no statistically significant effect on these injuries in 1992–1998.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is low. This means we are not confident that the differences in workplace injuries between firms that did and did not receive OSHA inspections are attributable to the inspections.","","The study examined the effect of OSHA inspections in manufacturing establishments on workplace injuries during three separate time periods: 1979–1985, 1987–1991, and 1992–1998. It analyzed the effect of having an inspection at any time during the preceding four years. Several types of OSHA inspections were analyzed: all inspections, inspections that resulted in a penalty, programmed inspections that resulted in a penalty, programmed inspections that did not result in a penalty, complaint inspections that resulted in a penalty, and complaint inspections that did not result in a penalty. In general, programmed inspections were conducted at randomly selected firms in high-injury industries, and complaint inspections were triggered by complaints filed by employees or their representatives.","The study used a regression model to compare the changes in workplace injuries in firms that had received an inspection within the preceding four years to those in firms that had not received inspections. The model included controls for employment, hours, industry, and year.
The authors used injury data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses and inspections data from OSHA’s Integrated Management Information System for manufacturing establishments in the 29 federal OSHA states from 1979 to 1998. The sample included 6,842 plants in 1979–1985, 14,386 plants in 1987–1991, and 8,161 plants in 1992–1998.","The study found that OSHA inspections as a whole were associated with statistically significant reductions in lost-workday injuries of 10 percent in 1979–1985 and 4 percent in 1987–1991, but had no statistically significant effect on these injuries in 1992–1998. 
OSHA inspections that resulted in a penalty were associated with statistically significant decreases in lost-workday injuries in 1979–1985 (19 percent) and 1987–1991 (11 percent). 
Programmed OSHA inspections that resulted in a penalty were associated with statistically significant reductions in lost-workday injuries in 1979–1985 (19 percent) and 1987–1991 (13 percent). However, programmed OSHA inspections that did not result in a penalty were associated with statistically significant increases in these injuries in 1987–1991 (10 percent) and 1992–1998 (18 percent).
OSHA inspections triggered by a complaint that resulted in a penalty were associated with statistically significant decreases in lost-workday injuries in 1979–1985 (12 percent) and 1987–1991 (6 percent), and OSHA inspections triggered by a complaint that did not result in a penalty were associated with statistically significant decreases in these injuries only in 1979–1985 (9 percent).","In this study, the estimated differences between firms in the changes in injury rates may not be caused by the OSHA inspections. The differences in injury rates could reflect underlying differences in safety levels or other factors between the firms being compared. For example, the firms that received inspections based on complaints likely had more underlying workplace hazards, on average, than firms that were not inspected; therefore, we cannot be confident that the groups being compared are similar in any analysis that includes this inspection type.
A comparison of only firms that received random inspections relative to all similar plants would provide a strong test of the causal impact of random inspections. However, the analysis in this study introduced nonrandom factors because it estimated impacts separately for firms that received random inspections and did or did not receive a penalty. For example, the firms that received a penalty may have experienced different changes in injury rates as conditions deteriorated or because management would have made improvements to address unsafe working conditions, even without the inspection and penalty.","",""

SPI was meant to increase employment and earnings for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) beneficiaries through the provision of direct services.
The study’s data were collected from Social Security Administration (SSA) administrative data and the Summary Earnings Record (SER). The authors estimated program impacts on employment and earnings.
The study found that SPI had negative and statistically significant impacts on employment and earnings, contrary to the initiative’s intent.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it is based on a well-conducted randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the effects estimated in the study are attributable solely to the SPI, and not to other factors.","This study was conducted by staff from Mathematica Policy Research, which administers CLEAR. Therefore, the review of this study was conducted by an independent consultant trained in applying the CLEAR causal evidence guidelines.","From 1998 to 2004 the SSA and Rehabilitation Services Administration provided five-year funding for 12 SPI states to implement innovative projects to help people with disabilities find jobs. Although each state’s intervention design and target population varied, all SPI states aimed to increase beneficiaries’ understanding of how work affects benefits through activities such as providing information and referrals, problem solving, benefits assistance, benefits planning, and long-term benefits management. Additional services that states could provide included placing funds in an individual career account, changes to SSI regulations allowing working recipients to save more, employment services, psychosocial rehabilitation, and situational assessments.
The three state projects covered in this report targeted working-age adults. New Hampshire accepted SSI and SSDI beneficiaries with any type of disability. New York and Oklahoma both targeted people with mental illness, and Oklahoma included only SSI recipients who were not already employed. The New York SPI project included two separate programs, one offering benefits counseling and SSI regulation changes and the other offering those services plus employment services.","The three SPI state projects covered in this report were evaluated using a randomized controlled trial. Each state conducted randomization slightly differently: Oklahoma conducted random assignment before contacting participants; New York asked eligible beneficiaries if they were interested in working and randomly assigned those interested in the project; and New Hampshire randomly assigned people who had already volunteered for the intervention. Those randomly assigned to the treatment group could receive information about benefits and additional services offered as part of the SPI. Those randomly assigned to the control group could not receive SPI services.
The evaluation used SSA administrative data for six-month employment rates and the SER, an extract of the Master Earnings File, for one-year employment rates and earnings. The authors used an adjusted, difference-in-differences model to estimate impacts on employment and earnings in the six months following random assignment and in the year following the year of random assignment, relative to employment and earnings in various pre-random assignment periods.","In New York, those randomly assigned to the SPI benefits counseling without employment services group earned $343 less overall relative to two years before random assignment, compared with the control group’s change in earnings over the same period. This difference was statistically significant. There were no other impacts on employment rates or earnings measured six months or one year after random assignment.
There were no statistically significant impacts on employment or earnings in any follow-up period for the SPI group randomly assigned to receive benefits counseling plus employment services in New York.
In New Hampshire, those who received SSDI benefits (but not SSI benefits) and were randomly assigned to the SPI group were 29.6 percentage points less likely to be employed and earned $1,633 less in the year after random assignment, relative to the year before random assignment, compared with the control group’s change in employment and earnings over the same period. These differences were statistically significant.
The SPI state project in Oklahoma had no impact on earnings or employment at any follow-up period.","Due to the data’s configuration, employment and earnings impacts were estimated at the end of the calendar year that followed the calendar year of random assignment. Because each state project started at a different time, exposure lengths varied: the SPI group in Oklahoma was enrolled an average of 217 days; those in New York were enrolled 407 and 399 days for the benefits counseling and the counseling plus employment services groups, respectively; and those in New Hampshire were enrolled an average of 549 days. In Oklahoma, there was a lag between when random assignment occurred and when the project actually started.
The authors indicated that a number of similar interventions aiming to improve employment and earnings for people with disabilities were implemented at the same time and in many of the same states as SPI. Although it is not clear to what extent these other interventions affected the SPI treatment and control groups, the study seems to suggest that some SPI control group members might have received very similar services through the Benefits Planning, Assistance, and Outreach project.","Three SPI state projects implemented random assignment.

The study was a randomized controlled trial in which students were randomly assigned to the Opening Doors learning community treatment group or the control group. Data sources included students’ transcript data provided by Kingsborough and data from a baseline survey completed by students at the time of random assignment.
This study found that the Opening Doors learning community program at Kingsborough had positive impacts on developmental course enrollment and passage rates, percentage and number of courses passed, equated credits earned in the program semester, and developmental course enrollment in the first postprogram semester. During the first academic year, Opening Doors students earned significantly more equated credits and made significantly more progress in required English courses than the control group.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Opening Doors learning communities, and not to other factors.","","At Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn, New York, the Opening Doors learning communities program involved enrolling small cohorts of students in three linked courses during one semester. These learning communities involved an English course, a college-level course required for a specific major, and a one-credit freshman orientation class. The freshman orientation class was a seminar designed to reinforce the learning objectives of the other two courses and provide students practical information about careers in their selected majors. The instructor of this course also served as a case manager for the students in the learning community, meeting with faculty members to ensure the success of learning community students. In addition, each learning community member had a tutor who provided students with one-on-one tutoring; learning community students were also provided with $225 textbook vouchers. This study focused on the first of four cohorts of students who participated in learning communities from fall 2003 to spring 2005.
To participate in the Opening Doors learning communities, students had to be first-time incoming freshman ages 17 to 34 who planned to attend college full-time during the day, and be enrolled in either a developmental or college-level English course. Although not a specific requirement for eligibility throughout program implementation, the program targeted low- and moderate-income students.","This study was a randomized controlled trial. Randomization occurred at the student level. Eligible students who consented to participate in the study filled out a baseline data form. Then, they were randomized to either the treatment group, which was offered the opportunity to enroll in a learning community, or the control group, which could not enroll in a learning community, but could access existing college services. This study reported results for the first cohort of students who entered the study in fall 2003. There were 387 students in this cohort with 192 in the treatment group and 195 in the control group. (The full study sample consisted of 1,534 students with 769 in the treatment group and 765 in the control group.)
The authors used student transcript data and reported impacts on courses taken and passed and credits earned during the program semester and the first postprogram semester, and registration/enrollment status for the second postprogram semester. One of the outcomes was equated credits earned; these are class hours in developmental and compensatory courses for which actual credits are not allowed, but they are counted as regular credits for certain purposes, such as determining financial aid availability. Impacts were estimated using two-tailed t-tests applied to unadjusted differences between the treatment and control groups.","In the program semester (fall 2003), students in the treatment group were 15 percent more likely to take one or more English courses overall and 11 percent more likely to take a developmental English course than control students. They were 20 percent more likely to pass one or more English courses overall and 16 percent more likely to pass a developmental English course. They were about 57 percent more likely to take and pass the student development course. They passed 8 percent more courses (0.5 courses) and earned 1.5 more equated credits. All these differences were statistically significant.
In the first postprogram semester (spring 2004), students in the treatment group were about 10 percentage points more likely to take one or more English courses than control students. This difference was statistically significant.
During the first academic year overall, students in the treatment group earned significantly more equated credits (4.9 versus 3.5 for the control group) and were more likely to have either completed or enrolled in one or both of the required, credit-bearing English courses as of spring 2004 (52 versus 42 percent for the control group).","The study was a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. However, participants were randomly assigned in slightly different ways—those who enrolled early enough were told about the program individually during the early registration period, whereas those who enrolled later (the majority) were recruited into the study in groups during a registration fair in the week before the start of the semester. Otherwise, the eligibility requirement and randomization procedure did not change and the authors did not discuss any potential issues stemming from this change in procedure. The authors cautioned that the results for the first cohort of this multiyear evaluation, which is the focus of this study, should be interpreted with care because the program might have been implemented with greater fidelity and consistency in the later semesters.
The study authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to progress toward degree completion. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","",""

The authors also examined the impact of the Washington Reemployment Bonus Demonstration; this study is an additional source to the main source examining that intervention, profiled here.
About 15,000 eligible claimants were randomly assigned to one of six treatment groups or a control group. The six treatment groups were offered different combinations of reemployment bonus amounts and periods within which they were required to find a job in order to claim the bonus. The authors analyzed state administrative data and survey data of a subsample of approximately 5,000 participants from the original demonstration.
The study found that the pooled bonus treatments in Pennsylvania reduced the total UI benefit amount received, but did not have a significant impact on earnings. Pooling across all bonus treatments, Pennsylvania treatment group members received $113 less in UI benefits, on average, than their control group counterparts.
The quality of causal evidence for the Pennsylvania demonstration is low because the authors did not demonstrate that they adjusted for changes in rates of assignment to treatment and control conditions and did not ensure that the groups being compared were similar before the intervention.

Therefore, an independent consultant trained in applying the CLEAR causal evidence guidelines reviewed this study.","Implemented in 12 randomly selected offices across Pennsylvania, the demonstration restricted eligibility to UI claimants who had filed within the past two weeks, did not have a definite recall date to their former employer, and did not routinely obtain employment through a union hiring hall. The demonstration had six different bonus offerings. The first four entailed different combinations of reemployment bonus amounts—either three or six times the UI weekly benefit amount—and periods within which participants were required to find a job in order to claim the bonus, known as a qualification period. The qualification period was either 6 or 12 weeks. The fifth type of bonus declined from the highest amount (six times the weekly benefit amount) to zero over the course of the benefit period, and the sixth was essentially the same as the fourth, except that it excluded the offer of a job search workshop, which was available to all five other bonus groups. To claim any bonus, claimants needed to maintain employment for four months.","In 1988 and 1989, about 15,000 eligible UI claimants in Pennsylvania were randomly assigned into one of the six reemployment bonus groups or a control group. Participants randomly assigned to the control group received the same weekly UI benefits payments over the same maximum weeks of eligibility, but were not offered a reemployment bonus. Using data from UI administrative records, the study estimated the average difference between the pooled treatment groups and the control group on UI benefit amounts and earnings approximately one year after program enrollment.","UI benefit receipt

Under this model, local employers help design training programs and provide them in a work-like environment to economically disadvantaged youth who are not in school or employed. A separate report examined CET implementation.
The effectiveness of the CET model in improving employment, earnings, and participation in education and training programs was evaluated using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in 12 sites in seven states.
The study found few statistically significant impacts on outcomes measured over a 54-month follow-up period.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this study is moderate. This means we have confidence that the effects estimated in this study are attributable at least in part to the CET program. However, other factors not accounted for in the study might also have contributed to the estimated effect.","","The CET program targets disadvantaged, out-of-school youth ages 16 to 21. It was first implemented in a site in San Jose, California. Two RCTs conducted in the late 1980s confirmed that CET-San Jose produced positive results for participating youths. Therefore, the U.S. Department of Labor initiated a replication study to discover whether the CET-San Jose model could be implemented successfully in other settings. The CET replication sites agreed to participate in the replication study, and the national CET office in San Jose provided each site with technical assistance.
The CET model has four core features:
It provides occupational and basic skills training in a work-like setting, and trainees advance at their own pace.
It requires a full-time commitment from students, to accustom them to a work schedule.
It maintains close connections to employers, who help design and implement the training programs.
It has an extensive orientation process, during which the rigor of the program is emphasized; less motivated individuals may drop out at that point.","The study was an RCT conducted in 12 sites across the country. From 1995 to 1999, the study authors randomly assigned 748 youth to a treatment group eligible to receive CET services and 737 youth to a control group ineligible to receive CET services for 24 months. The authors estimated the effectiveness of the CET program by comparing outcomes of youth in the CET group to outcomes of youth in the control group. The outcomes of interest were employment, earnings, and participation in education and training programs measured up to 54 months after random assignment.","The authors reported impacts for eight earnings and employment outcomes measured less than one year after random assignment; none of these was statistically significant.
The authors also reported impacts on 21 employment and earnings outcomes measured from 12 to 54 months after random assignment. Two of these were statistically significant: the percentage of individuals who worked 35 hours a week or more in their most recent job was 6 percentage points higher in the CET group than in the control group, and the percentage of individuals holding a total of one job during the 54-month follow-up period was 4 percentage points lower in the CET group than in the control group.
The study also reported impacts for 80 outcomes related to participation and attainment in education and/or training programs. In general, these impacts indicated that CET group members were more likely to participate in a training program within the first year of random assignment, but this impact declined in subsequent years. In addition, CET group members were more likely than control group members to receive a training certificate.","Implementing the CET model at the replication sites was challenging. The study reported that only 4 of the 12 sites implemented the model with high fidelity, 6 others implemented the program with medium fidelity, and 2 did so with low fidelity. The authors identified organizational stability as a key feature of successful programs; those that had high turnover in leadership and staff were less successful than more stable programs at sustaining the program model. Difficulty developing close relationships with employers was another challenge to successful implementation.
The study authors estimated multiple related impacts on employment, earnings, education, and training. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings from the study is likely to be overstated.","El Centro, California

ETA Occasional Paper 2005-06. [WIA Dislocated Worker]","The study’s objective was to examine the impact of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) Dislocated Worker Program’s core, intensive, and training services on the employment rate, earnings, and benefits receipt of low-income dislocated workers ages 22 to 64.
The authors established three treatment groups based on the level of WIA services used and matched them to three comparison groups that participated in Employment Services (ES) and/or the core WIA services.
The study found that the employment rate and average quarterly earnings were significantly higher for those in each of the treatment groups compared with their matched comparison groups. Benefit receipt was also significantly lower for those in the treatment groups than in their comparison groups.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not ensure that the groups being compared were similar before program participation. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the WIA Dislocated Worker Program; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The WIA Dislocated Worker Program was authorized by Title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 and was superseded by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), effective in July 2015. The Dislocated Worker Program services, which remained essentially the same under WIOA, were designed to provide quality employment and training services to eligible workers. Administered through local workforce investment areas, the Dislocated Worker Program served people who had been laid off from employment, including those whose employers had closed permanently and who were unlikely to return to their previous industry of occupation. Eligible workers could receive three tiers of services through WIA. Core services were available to everyone and included job placement assistance, skills assessments, and provision of information on the labor market, among other services. Those unable to obtain a job through core services alone could receive intensive services—which included counseling and specialized assessments—and vouchers for attending training. In addition, some local areas provided supportive services such as child care, transportation, and work-related financial assistance to those who qualified.","The study included a sample of dislocated workers who received core, training, or intensive services through the WIA Dislocated Worker Program from among 92,787 workers who received services from either the WIA Adult or WIA Dislocated Worker programs. These dislocated workers were ages 22 to 64 and exited the program from July 2000 to June 2002 and were observed for up to eight quarters after program exit. Their earnings were also below the top 0.5 percent of all earners in all quarters of the study period.
The authors used administrative data sources, including WIA Standardized Record Data, ES and Unemployment Insurance records, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) records from each state to compare the number of quarters employed, quarterly earnings, and months of receipt of TANF benefits of WIA participants with those of the ES participants who exited the program at the same time.
The authors established three treatment groups based on the level of WIA services used: (1) workers who received any of the employment-related services available through the WIA Dislocated Worker Program, (2) workers who received the training services available through the WIA Dislocated Worker Program, and (3) workers who received the intensive or training services available through the WIA Dislocated Worker Program. The respective three comparison groups were (1) workers who participated in the ES program, (2) WIA Dislocated Worker Program participants who did not receive the available training services, and (3) ES participants combined with workers who received only core services available through the WIA Dislocated Worker Program.","Employment. The percentage of quarters employed after program exit was significantly higher for dislocated workers who took part in WIA Dislocated Worker Program services compared with those in the comparison groups, with estimates across the three contrasts ranging from 5.9 to 13.5 percentage points.
Earnings. Average quarterly earnings were significantly higher for dislocated workers who took part in WIA Dislocated Worker Program services compared with those in the comparison groups, with estimates across the three contrasts ranging from $386 to $951.
Benefits receipt. Those who took part in the WIA Dislocated Worker Program services received TANF benefits for a significantly lower percentage of months after program exit compared with those in the comparison groups, with estimates across the three contrasts ranging from 1.0 to 1.9 percentage points.","Although the authors accounted for many underlying characteristics of the groups being compared, which could also influence their outcomes, the authors’ decision to define the groups based on their date of program exit rather than program entry is problematic. For example, suppose that the WIA and ES participants were on identical wage trajectories before receiving services from their respective programs and that the average length of participation in WIA services was six months, whereas that for Employment Services was one month. At the conclusion of participation, they exited the program.
If we compared the groups’ earnings 6 months after their recorded exit dates, we would observe WIA participants’ earnings about 12 months after they started receiving services and ES participants’ earnings about 7 months after they started receiving services. If both programs were completely ineffective, and everyone stayed on their original upward-sloping wage trajectory, it would appear as though the WIA participants earned more 6 months after their exit dates. However, this would not be attributable to receiving WIA services; it would have been caused by the different elapsed time across the groups (12 months for WIA participants versus 7 months for ES participants). Therefore, studies defining the groups based on exit date, rather than entry date, cannot receive a moderate causal evidence rating. This would also be true when comparing employment rates and benefits receipt.","The study used administrative data from the following states:
Florida
Georgia
Illinois
Maryland

It also sought to examine perceptions of whether the YO program had been implemented well and had enhanced the communities.
Funded by the U.S. Department of Labor in 2000, the YO initiative looked to transform distressed neighborhoods by engaging youth in positive and productive activities and relationships. Programs were to provide education, employment, support, and leadership development services to youth ages 14 to 21 in high-poverty urban, rural, and Native American communities.
The authors performed an ethnographic analysis based on site profiles for 35 YO communites. They also used U.S. Census data to further understand the characteristics of the communities.
The authors described the social and economic trends of the 35 sites at length, focusing on the persistent and systemic obstacles facing the communities, including population decline, housing stress, and high rates of teen pregnancy. Participating communities had high rates of poverty and few quality jobs available. 
The authors did not find a consensus about how well the YO initiative had been implemented in the communities. However, most community members, including participating youth, did strongly agree that YO programming benefited youth.","","","","","","",""

The authors used a random assignment design and multivariate regression analysis to estimate impacts on aggregate recidivism scores, the sum of all subsequent offenses, weighted by severity. Data for the study were collected from standardized forms, surveys, risk assessment tests, and state agency and police records.
The study found no statistically significant effects of the program on participants’ aggregate recidivism scores.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate for some outcomes and low for other outcomes. This means we have little confidence that any estimated effects would be attributable to the IAP. However, the study found few statistically significant effects.","","The IAPs in the study were implemented by juvenile correctional facilities managed by county juvenile justice departments. The program components included an assessment for risks and needs; individualized case planning to determine and prioritize service needs and determine a timeline for addressing them; continuity in case management and service delivery; coordination of pre- and post- release staff and program administrators; formalized transitions to facilitate post-incarceration reentry into the community; intensive supervision; and use of appropriately fitted and immediately applied rewards and sanctions that were scaled to match the severity or positivity of actions.","The study took place in three juvenile justice facilities that received grants to implement the IAP. The program in Colorado served high-risk youth from the Denver metropolitan area who were incarcerated at Lookout Mountain Youth Services Center in Golden, Colorado; the program in Nevada was operated by the Clark County Youth Parole Bureau for high-risk youth from Clark County; and the program in Virginia was operated by the Virginia Department of Juvenile Justice and served high-risk youth from the city of Norfolk assigned to either the Beaumont or Hanover Juvenile Correctional Centers.
The authors randomly assigned eligible youth to either a treatment group, which could participate in IAP, or a control group, which received the transitional and post-incarceration services typically available in the community. A total of 515 youth were randomized into either treatment or control groups across three programs under study, and data on 435 youth were available for outcomes and impact analysis. Youth were eligible for the study if they were male, had been committed to the custody of juvenile correction agency, had been placed within a participating correctional facility in a county participating in the study, and scored as being at high risk for reoffense using a locally validated risk-assessment tool. Youth who had committed sexual offenses, were in custody until after age 21, or had a mental health diagnosis requiring special attention or treatment were not eligible for the study.
The authors collected data on characteristics and outcomes of interest from a series of forms, surveys, standardized tests, and state agency and police records one year after program participation. The primary outcome of interest was a criminal offense recidivism score, which represented the mean seriousness and frequency of criminal arrests during the follow-up period.","The study did not find a statistically significant effect of IAP on the criminal offense recidivism score.","Although the study was based on a randomized controlled trial, all three of the participating sites had high study attrition. Randomized controlled trials with high attrition are evaluated against the CLEAR evidence guidelines for nonexperimental analyses. The analysis of the criminal offense recidivism score included controls for criminal history, race, previous mental health or school discipline problems, gang membership, and having a family member incarcerated, among other characteristics. Therefore, this analysis receives a moderate evidence rating. However, the analyses of other outcomes in the study did not include these control variables, and therefore they receive a low causal evidence rating.
The authors calculated that, given the small sample sizes and other features of their study and analysis, they would be able to detect statistically significant differences in the recidivism rate of only 22 percentage points or larger.","",""

The authors randomly assigned eligible youth to either the treatment group that received ROPP or a control group that received standard probation services. Using data from the Los Angeles Unified School District and probation records, the authors compared the educational outcomes and average recidivism rates of the two groups.
The study found that ROPP had some early positive impacts on educational outcomes, but many of these gains faded after the first six months of the program. The study also found initial improvements (reductions) in recidivism for the treatment group during the first six months. There were no statistically significant effects of participation in the program on violations of probation.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it was based on a randomized controlled trial with high attrition that sufficiently accounted for other relevant factors. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Los Angeles County ROPP, but other factors might also have contributed.","","The Los Angeles County ROPP offered a suite of coordinated social services aimed at improving school outcomes and reducing the risk of repeat involvement in the criminal justice system. Youth placed on juvenile probation were eligible to participate if they were from the South Central Los Angeles area; were younger than 15-and-a-half years old; and had specific risk factors for recidivism in terms of school behavior or academic problems, history of family problems such as abuse, substance-abuse, and pre-delinquent behavior. Program participants were assigned to a dedicated ROPP deputy probation officer (each with a caseload of 15 to 25 youth) and received a wide array of tailored services including, but not limited to academic tutoring, counseling, gang prevention training, substance abuse education and treatment, and career counseling and employment services.
ROPP deputy probation officers (DPOs) provided participants with an orientation to the program within two days of enrollment and led discussions with youth and their parents starting within two weeks of orientation to develop individualized service plans and link families with service providers. Services, based at one of several comprehensive service sites, began within a week of these initial meetings. Throughout the program, youth met weekly with their ROPP DPO. On average, ROPP DPOs contacted each youth about six times per month, contacted a parent of each youth more than once a month, and contacted a teacher or service provider more than twice a month.","The authors randomly assigned 327 eligible youth to either the ROPP or control group during the course of the program, which began in September 1999 and ended in 2001. The analysis restricted the sample to youth who successfully terminated their probation term within the two-year study window. The resulting sample of 204 youth was approximately 80 percent male, 60 percent black, and 40 percent Hispanic.
Youth assigned to the treatment group received the opportunity to participate in ROPP. Youth assigned to the control group received standard probation supervised by DPOs (with standard caseloads of 100 to 150 juvenile offenders each) and did not receive any of the specialized services ROPP offered. Standard probation included mandatory monthly meetings with the assigned DPO, referrals to other social services, and often included mandated programs for families, such as parenting classes.
Using data from the Los Angeles Unified School District and DPO case records, the authors compared the average recidivism rates and education outcomes of the two groups. Recidivism was measured by the number of violations of probation and new law violations during the two-year study period. Educational outcomes included school attendance, number of courses passed, and grade point averages. Statistical tests confirmed that the treatment and control groups were similar in terms of age, race, gender, prior involvement with the justice system, and family and school risk factors.","The study found that the program had some initial positive impacts on education and reduced recidivism, but that many of these gains faded after the first six months of the program.
Among educational outcomes, the study found that youth in the ROPP group attended more days of school (ranging from an additional 10 to 16 days) in each of the six-month follow-up periods compared with the control group.
The authors also found that youth in the ROPP group passed a higher number of school courses (an additional 0.86 courses) and had higher grade point averages (an additional 0.028 points), compared with youth in the control group; however, these differences were not significant after six months.
Among criminal justice outcomes, the authors found that youth assigned to the ROPP group had fewer new law violations in the first six months of the program than youth in the control group (10 percentage points less), but no differences remained for these outcomes after six months. There were no significant differences in the number of probation violations between the ROPP and control group.","The authors included in their analysis only youth who completed the probation program successfully. Youth who moved from the south central Los Angeles area, died, remained on active probation when ROPP terminated, or were sent to other correctional facilities were removed from the evaluation sample. The authors documented the number of youth dropped from the sample for each reason by study condition. However, the results of the study are generalizable only to youth who completed probation and not to all court-involved youth.","",""

Using data from the state’s administrative records and unemployment insurance program, the authors compared the quarterly earnings of women who took part in the training activities with those who enrolled in the welfare-to-work program but never took part in any of the training.
The study found that those taking part in the training activities experienced an initial (quarter 1) reduction in their quarterly earnings, compared with those who did not take part in the training activities. However, both cumulative (based on all 16 quarters of follow-up) and average (based on quarters 11 to 15) quarterly earnings increased for those who took part in the training activities compared with those who did not.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it was based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the welfare-to-work program training activities, but other factors might also have contributed.","","The Missouri welfare-to-work program offered three different categories of training activities: (1) assessment, including formal paper-and-pencil testing and the development of a self-sufficiency plan; (2) job-search and job-readiness training; and (3) intensive training, which included work experience, vocational and technical skills training, postsecondary education courses, and basic education activities (public school attendance up to grade 12, English as a second language courses, literacy courses, and adult education courses that prepared the candidate for a high school equivalency diploma).
Most TANF recipients were required to participate in the training activities. The program exempted certain recipients from the program training activities, such as those with very young children, those facing too many obstacles to participate according to their caseworker, and those who already worked a minimum number of hours. Those required to participate in the program faced a reduction in their benefits of about 25 percent if they chose not participate.
Missouri’s welfare-to-work program emphasized the intensive training components, rather than adopting a work-first strategy, which would have focused on moving welfare recipients into jobs as quickly as possible with training and education being a secondary consideration.","This nonexperimental analysis included 939,405 women ages 18 to 65 who became new cash recipients of TANF from the second quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1999. The authors used a statistical model to compare the quarterly earnings of women who took part in any of the training activities of the welfare-to-work program and those who did not. The authors also compared those who participated in each category of training activity with those who chose not to participate at all. For example, the authors compared the quarterly earnings of participants who completed only the assessment with those who completed none of the training activities.","The study found an initial (quarter 1) reduction in quarterly earnings of $297 for women who took part in any of the welfare-to-work program training activities, compared with those who took part in none of the training activities. This reduction was statistically significant (CLEAR calculations). However, the cumulative (based on all 16 quarters of follow-up) and average (based on quarters 11 to 15 of follow-up) quarterly earnings of those who took part in any of the training activities increased by $82 and $37, respectively. The increase in cumulative earnings was not statistically significant, but the increase in average quarterly earnings from quarters 11 to 15 was (CLEAR calculations).
Compared with those who took part in none of the training activities, those who took part in only the assessment activities experienced an initial reduction in quarterly earnings of $187, but an increase in both cumulative and average quarterly earnings of $625 and $9, respectively. The initial reduction and cumulative increase in earnings was statistically significant but the increase in average quarterly earnings was not (CLEAR calculations).
Compared with those who took part in none of the training activities, those who took part in the job-search and job-readiness activities experienced an initial reduction in quarterly earnings of $299 and decreased cumulative and average quarterly earnings of $117 and $68, respectively. The reduction in initial earnings and average quarterly earnings were statistically significant but the decrease in cumulative earnings was not (CLEAR calculations).
Compared with those who took part in none of the training activities, those who took part in the intensive training activities experienced an initial reduction in quarterly earnings of $462, but an increase in both cumulative and average quarterly earnings of $461 and $186, respectively. All three findings were statistically significant (CLEAR calculations).","The authors included each unique welfare enrollment spell individually in the analysis, meaning that individuals might be included in the study multiple times if they exited and reentered the TANF program. The analysis therefore estimated the impact of welfare-to-work program training activities for each entry into the TANF program. This approach could lead to impact estimates that appear to be more precise than they really are because it did not account for the identity of the individual experiencing multiple spells.
In addition, the authors noted that the results might be biased due to selection effects. For example, as participation in welfare-to-work program activities was required for those who were unable to find employment, training might have occurred when these people were at a low level of earnings and therefore their earnings could be expected to improve regardless of the intervention. This could mean that the estimated impacts reflected the effects of such differences between the treatment and comparison groups as well as the impact of the welfare-to-work program training activities.
Finally, the study authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to quarterly earnings. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","",""

The Houston site was one of three in Texas that participated in the Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) project.
The authors randomly assigned 1,816 unemployed single-parent participants in Houston’s Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program to either a treatment group that received ERA services or a control group that received standard TANF services. The authors analyzed data from Unemployment Insurance (UI), TANF, and Food Stamps administrative records.
The study did not find any statistically significant effects of the Houston ERA program on employment, earnings, and benefits receipt one year after random assignment.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we would be confident that any estimated effects are attributable to the Houston ERA program and not to other factors. However, the study did not find any statistically significant effects.","","The ERA project was introduced in 1999 as a nationwide exploration of factors that help welfare recipients not only find employment but retain their positions and advance in their careers. Texas was one of 16 sites across the United States to receive funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to implement a program intended to improve welfare recipients’ employment outcomes. (The authors reported results for three sites in Texas, including Houston, separately, so CLEAR also reviewed the results for those sites separately.)
TANF recipients assigned to the Texas ERA program in Houston attended a four-day job-search workshop after attending an initial orientation. They then spent four to six weeks searching for jobs and the program assigned those who did not then secure employment to community service or volunteer positions. People who found jobs were eligible for a $200 monthly stipend for up to 12 nonconsecutive months if they were employed for at least 30 hours per week, participated in a postemployment advancement activity, or left TANF; or if they worked 15 hours per week and participated in an education and training activity. The first 4 months of earnings for people in the program were disregarded when calculating their eligibility for a stipend. Texas ERA staff also helped clients with job-related problems, reemployment assistance, and support meeting stipend requirements. Program staff made regular employer site visits. Participants were eligible for these services as long as they were eligible for the monthly stipend. Program staff coordinated case management services (including employment assessment, goal-setting and career planning, support services, barrier resolution, and job-search assistance) across several partner agencies.","From January 2001 through December 2002, 1,950 unemployed, single-parent TANF recipients were randomly assigned to either a treatment group, which received ERA services, or a control group, which received standard TANF services through the existing welfare-to-work Choices program. This program also provided case management and supportive services, but without the team-based approach used in ERA. Also in contrast to ERA, Choices case management services typically did not focus on long-range career goal-setting and planning.

Supported employment interventions use a combination of employment and health services and supports to improve employment and other outcomes. 
The authors analyzed data from seven sites, each of which implemented a distinct supported employment intervention using a randomized controlled trial. At each site, researchers interviewed participants in person twice yearly and collected weekly employment data.
The supported employment interventions had a significant and positive impact on employment, working for 40 or more hours in a single month, and monthly earnings from paid employment.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is moderate. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the supported employment interventions, but other factors might also have contributed.","","Supported employment interventions use a combination of employment and health services and supports to improve employment and other outcomes for people with psychiatric conditions. The supported employment programs in this study shared five core features:
Integrated services delivered by a multidisciplinary team that met at least three times per week to plan and coordinate employment interventions, psychiatric treatment, and case management
Placement into competitive employment
Jobs tailored to participants’ career preferences
Immediate job search beginning at program entry
Ongoing vocational support","The study team recruited volunteers for the study. Candidates who responded to outreach efforts—self-referral, family referral, word of mouth, and advertisements—were considered eligible if they had a qualifying diagnosis, had exhibited symptoms for a sufficient period, were age 18 or older, had expressed willingness to work, and had provided written informed consent. A total of 1,648 eligible participants were randomly assigned to the treatment group, which received supported employment services, or the control group, which received a comparison condition that varied by site (exact breakdowns by treatment group are unknown). The analysis sample consisted of 1,273 study participants (648 treatment and 625 control).
Researchers interviewed all participants at baseline and twice yearly thereafter, in addition to collecting weekly employment records. They computed impacts on competitive employment—which the authors defined as a position in a privately held, socially integrated setting not reserved for people with disabilities that paid at least minimum wage—working 40 or more hours a month, and monthly earnings at 24 months after random assignment.","The study found that the supported employment interventions had a significant and positive effect on the probability of being competitively employed, working for 40 or more hours in a single month, and monthly earnings from paid employment.
Specifically, higher proportions of treatment group members secured competitive employment (55 versus 34 percent) and worked 40 or more hours in a given month during the 24-month study period (51 versus 39 percent). Treatment group members also had higher earnings than control group members over the follow-up period ($122 per month versus $99 per month).","The study had high attrition. Hence, it was not eligible for a high evidence rating. However, the authors controlled for many relevant observable characteristics of the two groups.
The authors noted that the study sample was not nationally representative, which limits the results’ generalizability. In addition, the supported employment programs being evaluated differed across participating study sites, as did the services available to control group members.","The authors analyzed supported employment interventions in seven states:

The Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee, consisting of equal numbers of representatives from unions and employers, administered the joint apprentice programs. Employers’ contributions to a dedicated training trust fund supported these programs. All building trades commonly use this training trust fund model. Apprentices in programs sponsored with union participation received about 2,000 hours of on-the-job training and 144 hours of class instruction each year. Apprenticeship programs lasted from one to five years. Participants typically received 50 to 90 percent of journey-level wages and taught as they advanced in the program with no additional salary for this service. Programs with union sponsorship also facilitated job placement via union halls after apprentices completed their training. Apprenticeship programs not sponsored by a union were sponsored by one or more companies, varied in resources, and did not facilitate job search or placement services for apprentices.

The researchers compared the means of the SOCP and control groups at the end of the intervention and 18 months after the intervention.","The study found no statistically significant effect of SOCP participation on the criminal justice outcomes examined.","The authors noted that differences in measurement and the relative low-risk of youth in the study might have contributed to the null finding. Although youth in SOCP received significantly more contacts with probation officers and spent more time receiving probation services than control group youth, the probation officers keeping records of service receipt for the comparison group were not compensated by the grant and might have had less incentive to record all probation contacts. Therefore, the comparison group level of contact could be understated in the recorded data. SOCP intended to target medium- to high-risk youth, but the sample comprised youth with low, medium, and high risk levels. The authors suggested another reason for the null impact was that SOCP provided similar numbers of contacts to youth of all risk levels, instead of targeting higher-risk youth with more intensive services relative to lower-risk youth.","",""

First, she implemented a contract in which she promised students would earn no worse than a C grade overall if they attended class regularly, submitted homework assignments on time, attended discussion sections and laboratories, and met with an external tutor to address poor midterm exam performance. The contract also offered students the opportunity to resubmit unsuccessful homework assignments and lab reports. Second, in each lecture, the professor collected anonymous written feedback regarding homework difficulty or other challenges and structured teaching practices to address these comments. For example, to shore up students’ self-esteem, the professor urged them to view their work in a more positive light and to proclaim their successes in lab. Finally, the professor encouraged students to participate in summer science internships at the university or in industry, curating a list of available opportunities and advocating for additional funding.","This study compared the final exam grades, final course grades, and internship acceptance rates of the 76 female students who experienced an innovative Organic Chemistry II course at Mount Holyoke College to those of the approximately 225 students in the same professor’s three previous Organic Chemistry II courses, all of which relied on the same syllabus.","The study identified no statistically significant relationships between the three teaching innovations and students’ outcomes.","The author did not establish the comparability of the treatment or comparison groups nor control for factors—such as age and previous achievement in STEM courses—that were likely to influence the outcomes of interest.

The study was a randomized controlled trial: Families newly applying to Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) or families that were recertifying their eligibility were randomly assigned to MFIP or AFDC. Evaluators analyzed outcomes using a 36-month follow-up survey and administrative data from the six years after the intervention.
The study found that, among single parents in the year after MFIP began, the MFIP group experienced higher rates of short-term employment and higher rates and levels of cash assistance than the AFDC group. For two-parent households, the study found that, in the first year after the study began, the MFIP group had lower rates of employment, lower levels of earnings, and higher rates and levels of benefits receipt than the AFDC group. In both family types, higher receipt of cash assistance for the MFIP group persisted through six years after the study began.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to MFIP, and not to other factors.","","MFIP, implemented in 1994 and a precursor to the national Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, used several strategies to encourage work among AFDC clients. First, the MFIP benefit calculation incentivized work by increasing the basic AFDC grant by 20 percent if clients worked and by reducing benefits by only 62 percent for every earned dollar (rather than a dollar-for-dollar reduction). These financial incentives remained in effect as long as clients remained on MFIP. Second, long-term welfare recipients (two-parent families that had received AFDC for more than 6 of the past 12 months) were required to participate in employment and training activities unless they met certain exemption criteria. Exemption criteria included working at least 30 hours per week, having a child younger than age one, or meeting good cause criteria. Recent AFDC applicants assigned to MFIP could also volunteer to participate in these activities. Employment and training activities emphasized quicker entry into the workforce and combining education and training with work. People who did not participate in employment and training activities could see their benefits reduced by 10 percent. Third, MFIP combined families’ AFDC, Food Stamps, and Family General Assistance, a state-funded cash assistance program, into a single program with one monthly payment; in addition, Food Stamp benefits were provided in cash, rather than as coupons. Finally, MFIP paid child care costs directly to providers rather than having parents pay out of pocket and receive reimbursement.","The study was a randomized controlled trial: 10,908 families newly applying to AFDC or recertifying their eligibility were randomly assigned to two groups: MFIP or AFDC. The two groups’ outcomes, measured using a 36-month follow-up survey and administrative data collected six years after randomization and adjusted for demographic characteristics, were compared. Researchers analyzed results for single- and two-parent families separately.","For single-parent families, the study found that MFIP increased employment and cash assistance receipt by statistically significant amounts. The quarterly employment rate in the first follow-up year was 49.0 percent for the MFIP group compared with 42.2 percent for the AFDC group; the quarterly rate of receipt of cash assistance in the first follow-up year was 82.3 percent for the MFIP group compared with 76.6 percent for the AFDC group; and the quarterly mean dollar amount of AFDC cash benefits received in the first follow-up year was $1,589 for the MFIP group compared with $1,359 for the AFDC group.
For two-parent households, the study found that participation in MFIP decreased employment and increased cash assistance receipt. In terms of employment and earnings, the quarterly rate of households with both parents employed in the first follow-up year was 22.3 percent for the MFIP group compared with 27.0 percent for the AFDC group and the mean household quarterly earnings were $2,320 for the MFIP group compared with $2,691 for the AFDC group. In the first follow-up year, the quarterly cash assistance benefit receipt rate was 76.4 percent for the MFIP group compared with 67.5 percent for the AFDC group and the mean quarterly amount of welfare benefits received was $1,815 for the MFIP group compared with $1,312 for the AFDC group.
This trend of increased public assistance in the treatment group persisted to the sixth follow-up year. In that year, for single parents, the mean quarterly amount of welfare benefits received was $416 for the MFIP group compared with $382 for the AFDC group. For two-parent families in year six, the quarterly cash assistance benefit receipt was 26.3 percent for the MFIP group compared with 22.3 percent for the AFDC group and the mean quarterly amount of welfare benefits received was $465 for the MFIP group compared with $394 for the AFDC group.","MFIP’s impacts for single- and two-parent families differed somewhat. Although single-parent households participating in MFIP experienced increases in both work and benefits receipt, two-parent families experienced lower rates of two-parent employment along with higher levels of benefits receipt. This could be the result of the program design for two-parent families: in two-parent families, only one MFIP parent was subject to the work requirement, so mothers in these families often did not work and offset the decrease in earned income with income from cash assistance.","",""

The Riverside Phase 2 site was one of two in Riverside that participated in the Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) project.
The authors randomly assigned eligible single-parent participants in Riverside’s Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program to one of two treatment groups (Work Plus and Training Focused) that received differing ERA services or to a control group that received standard TANF services. This review focuses on the comparison between the Work Plus program and the Training Focused program. The authors analyzed data from Unemployment Insurance (UI), TANF, and Food Stamps administrative records.
The study did not find any statistically significant effects of the Work Plus program on employment, earnings, and benefits receipt compared with the Training Focused program.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we would be confident that any estimated effects are attributable to the Riverside Work Plus program and not to other factors. However, the study did not find any statistically significant effects.","","The ERA project was introduced in 1999 as a nationwide exploration of factors that help welfare recipients not only find employment but retain their positions and advance in their careers. Riverside included 3 of 16 sites across the United States to receive funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to implement a program intended to improve welfare recipients’ employment outcomes. (The authors reported results for a third site in Riverside separately, so CLEAR also reviewed the results for that site separately.)
TANF recipients assigned to the Riverside Work Plus and the Training Focused programs could receive intensive case management and enhanced support services, all aimed at encouraging employment stability. In the Work Plus program, staff encouraged clients to attend education and training activities after working at least 20 hours per week. Participation in education and training activities was premised on the belief that working reinforces the value of education and training and that working while in school or in training increases the likelihood of program completion and the use of newly acquired skills. In the Training Focused program, clients had to participate in work and training activities for 32 hours per week. Staff encouraged clients to attend education and training (including vocational training) activities, and clients could reduce or eliminate their work hours if they participated in education and training.
Both programs also provided clients with support services (for example, child care, transportation, and ancillary payments to participate in program activities); social services (for example, mental health, domestic violence, and substance abuse); referrals to public assistance programs (for example, TANF, Food Stamps, and Medi-Cal); and job search services.","Eligible single parents in Riverside, CA were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a treatment group that was offered Work Plus services, a second treatment group that was offered the Training Focused program, or a comparison group (Work Focused). The authors estimated the effect of the Work Plus program compared with the Training Focused program on employment, earnings, and benefits receipt 12 months after random assignment using UI, TANF, and Food Stamps administrative records. This report focused on the sample of single parents randomly assigned from January 2001 to September 2002.","The study did not find any statistically significant effects of the Work Plus program on employment, earnings, and benefits receipt compared with the Training Focused program.","","",""

The strategy involved forming teams of mostly female engineering professors, students, and practitioners to train middle school teachers on engineering and gender-inclusive teaching methods and to serve as in-class role models for students.
The authors administered a study-designed survey at the beginning and end of the school year to a single cohort of students to measure changes in outcomes following implementation of the intervention. The authors estimated program impacts using regression models and paired t-tests.
The study found that students’ attitudes toward science improved after the intervention, but attitudes toward engineering worsened. There was no change in students’ attitudes toward math.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the 4 Schools for WIE strategy; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The 4 Schools for WIE strategy was implemented by faculty and students from engineering schools at four universities (Northeastern University, Tufts University, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and Boston University) in 8th-grade science classrooms in eight public school districts in the greater Boston area. The strategy involved forming teams of mostly female engineering professors, students, and practitioners to train middle school teachers on engineering and gender-inclusive teaching practices and to serve as in-class role models for students. Specifically, the mission of these STEM teams was to develop gender-equitable engineering curriculum units that could be used in 8th-grade science classrooms and to help the teachers implement the new units in their classes. It was expected that the presence of role models; the use of gender-inclusive teaching methods; and the introduction of a new, high quality curriculum would improve students’ attitudes toward STEM subjects and careers, particularly among girls.","The authors compared students’ attitudes toward STEM careers before and after implementation of the 4 Schools for WIE strategy in their science classrooms. Data were obtained from a survey administered to 436 8th-grade participants at the beginning and end of the school year. The authors estimated the impact of the program on changes in students’ attitudes toward STEM using regression models that controlled for whether the students found the class interesting; the students’ pre-intervention attitudes toward math, engineering, and science; and the difference in attitudes toward other STEM fields before and after the intervention. The authors also conducted paired t-tests to compare the average pre- and post-intervention attitudes of boys and girls overall.","The study found that students’ attitudes toward science improved after the intervention, but attitudes toward engineering worsened.

The study used a regression model to analyze annual changes in workplace injuries in manufacturing firms that received OSHA notifications of high existing injury rates and/or inspections in the current or past two years.
The study found that firms that received notifications without a subsequent inspection experienced a statistically significant decline in injury rates. Firms that received a notification and an inspection experienced larger declines.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this study is low. This means we are not confident that OSHA notifications and inspections caused the reductions in workplace injuries.","","The study examined the effect of two types of OSHA notifications—cooperative compliance letters and high hazard notifications letters—on workplace injuries. Letters were systematically sent to firms with high injury and illness rates to inform them of their classification as high-risk firms. Letters also indicated that firms had an increased chance of receiving an OSHA inspection in the coming year. The authors estimated the effect of these notifications when followed or not followed by a programmed inspection. The outcome of interest was the annual change in injuries in the year of inspection and for two subsequent years, measured by the difference in the natural log of the number of lost workday injuries and illnesses (LWDII).","The study used a regression model to compare the changes in workplace injury rates associated with OSHA notifications and inspections. Firms receiving a notification or inspection from OSHA authorities were compared with firms that did not receive this type of attention. Regressions included six variables of primary interest: indicators for having received an OSHA notification in the current year, one year ago, and two years ago and for having an associated programmed inspection in the current year, one year ago, and two years ago. The authors also controlled for the occurrence of other OSHA inspections in the current and past two years, the percentage change in employment and hours worked at the firm, indicators for unusual events occurring at a firm (for example, strikes or layoffs), two-digit Standard Industrial Classification code, and calendar year.
The authors used OSHA Data Initiative injury and illness data for 1995 to 2001, data on notifications from the databases tracking notifications from 1998 to 2001, and information on inspections from OSHA’s Integrated Management Information System Database for 1994 to 2001. The resulting data set contained 64,871 observations.","Firms that received an OSHA notification but no subsequent inspection experienced a statistically significant reduction in LWDII cases of 4.8 to 5.1 percent over three years.
Firms that received an OSHA notification followed by a programmed inspection experienced a larger, statistically significant reduction in LWDII cases of 12.0 to 13.8 percent over three years.","In this study, the estimated reductions in LWDII cases between firms that received OSHA notifications and associated inspections might not have been caused by the notifications and inspections themselves. The changes could instead reflect underlying differences in safety levels or other factors between the firms that received a notification and/or inspection and those that did not. For instance, only firms with relatively high existing injury rates received a notification, and these firms likely had more hazardous work sites. Thus, even in the absence of notifications, these firms might have experienced different changes in injury rates as conditions deteriorated or because management made improvements to address unsafe working conditions. Alternatively, firms with high injury rates could have had these high rates by chance. In subsequent years, injury rates would then be expected to decline to normal levels without any OSHA intervention.","",""

Participants assigned to the control conditions read different stories. After reading these stories, the participants responded to a short survey asking how much they liked the story and how interested they were in becoming physicists.

All participants, regardless of workshop participation, were randomly assigned to one of four study conditions.
In the treatment condition, participants read a story depicting a female physicist who used her work to benefit society. Participants in the three treatment conditions also read stories about scientists; one story described a male physicist who used his work to benefit society, whereas the other two described male and female physicists who chose their careers to make discoveries. After reading the stories, participants rated how much they liked the story and their interest in becoming a physicist. The authors conducted statistical analyses to compare participants’ liking of the stories and interest in becoming physicists in each condition.

Using data from a 13-item survey, the author compared employee turnover rates and promotions across organizations with differing human resource management practices, such as employee training programs and promotion strategies.
The study found no statistically significant relationships between employee training investment or turnover and the human resource management practices examined.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is low. This means that we would not be confident that any estimated effects would be attributable to the human resource management practices examined. However, the study found no statistically significant effects.","","Strategic human resource management involves designing and implementing policies and practices that support employees in achieving an organization’s objectives and, in turn, improving overall organizational health. Such practices are often viewed as an investment in both the individual and the organization. A common strategy involves employee training, an organized effort to encourage learning through instruction. Training programs can take many forms and target a variety of topics, such as general or firm-specific skills. Another such practice is promoting employees from within the company to fill vacancies, rather than searching outside of the company for suitable employees.","The study estimated the relationship between employer human resource management strategies and rates of employee turnover and promotions in 26 credit unions. The author developed a 13-item training and development survey to collect information on training programs and hiring practices used by the credit unions, including frequency and costs of training, yearly turnover rate, and promotion strategies. The author attempted to recruit human resource executives representing 500 credit unions with $100 million or more in total assets throughout the United States. Thirteen of them agreed to participate, completing the survey described above. Due to the low response rate, 200 smaller credit unions ($25 to $50 million in assets) were sampled, and 13 of these sites completed the survey, for a total sample size of 26 credit unions.
The author compared the outcomes of credit unions that had one type of human resource policy with firms that had the other type, as reported on the survey. For instance, the turnover rates of credit unions having a promote-from-within hiring strategy were compared with those of credit unions with hire-from-outside strategies.","The study found no statistically significant relationships between the human resource management practices examined and employee turnover or promotion rates.","In this study, human resource outcomes were evaluated among a sample of credit unions that agreed to participate in the study and disclose information about their training and promotion strategies. Credit unions that chose to participate in the study likely differed systematically from those that chose not to participate. For instance, small credit unions were more likely to participate than large ones. The author did not apply any statistical controls that would account for differences between the credit unions being examined or demonstrate that the groups of credit unions were similar on observed characteristics that might be related to the outcomes. Therefore, the observed differences in outcomes might reflect factors other than the credit unions’ human resource management strategies.","",""

Across the three experimental sites, average savings rates tended to increase, with higher increases for program participants than for nonparticipants.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is low. This low rating means that we are not confident that the difference in savings rates between program participants and nonparticipants results from participation in the savings plan.","","","","After implementing the SMarT program, average savings rates at the unnamed U.S. manufacturer increased from 4.4 to 10.6 percent of income.
Among the employees at the anonymous company, those who joined the SMarT plan observed the greatest increase in savings rates, from 3.5 percent of income before the program to 13.6 percent of income by the fourth pay raise after joining the program.
Average savings levels across all employees at Ispat Inland changed only slightly (from 5.5 to 5.8 percent of income) by the first pay raise after SMarT program implementation. However, savings rates among those who joined SMarT increased more over this period than did savings rates among those who did not enroll. Among employees who were already 401(k) plan participants, the saving rates among SMarT participants increased by 1.76 percentage points but decreased slightly for non-participants. Among employees who were not already 401(k) plan participants, increases were 2.28 and 0.26 percentage points, respectively.
Savings rates among SMarT enrollees at Philips Electronics were 1.3 percentage points higher than among employees in comparison divisions after program implementation; at each of the two divisions for which SMarT was available, the savings rate increased more among employees who had not previously been saving through the 401(k) plan.","In this study, employees at each of the three sites were offered the opportunity to enroll in the savings program. Thus, those who chose to enroll might differ systematically from those who chose not to enroll, whether in their predisposition or motivation to save for retirement or in other areas. Because the authors did not apply any statistical controls that would account for these differences or demonstrate that the groups were equivalent before enrolling or not enrolling in SMarT, the observed differences in savings rates might reflect factors other than savings program participation. It is also important to note that different sites applied different eligibility criteria that could also affect retirement savings outcomes. At Philips Electronics, for example, only less highly compensated employees were eligible to enroll in SMarT.","",""

About 1,100 9th-grade students from 11 high schools were randomly assigned to the treatment group, which could enroll in QOP, or to the control group, which could not participate in QOP activities. The study team administered a survey to treatment and control group members about seven years after program enrollment (three years after their scheduled graduation from high school) to collect information on postsecondary educational attainment and labor market outcomes.
Participation in QOP had no statistically significant impact on most measures of postsecondary attainment and employment.

Services were provided year-round for up to five years to enrollees who had not yet graduated from high school. After high school graduation, participants received some continued mentoring and assistance applying to postsecondary education or training. According to the program model, case managers were to serve 15 to 25 students, and annual participation goals were 750 hours per enrollee who had not yet graduated from high school. For this evaluation, QOP was operated by seven community-based organizations, each affiliated with one to three high schools (11 high schools in total).
Eligibility requirements for students included being in 9th grade for the first time during the 1995–1996 academic year (except at one site, for which the relevant academic school year was 1996–1997) and being in the bottom two-thirds of the grade point average distribution for their school in 8th grade. In addition, the students could not be so physically or learning disabled that, according to the school, the program was inappropriate for them.","Students who met eligibility requirements were randomly selected to participate in the study. Those who consented (about 1,100) were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group. The treatment group was allowed to participate in QOP activities, whereas the control group was not. Participants in both groups were surveyed about three years after their scheduled graduation from high school—when they were entering their early 20s—to collect information on their educational and labor market outcomes. High school transcripts for both groups were also collected.","Participation in QOP had no impact on high school completion or most measures of postsecondary attainment and employment.
Participation in QOP increased enrollment in college, vocational/technical school, an apprenticeship, or the military by 10 percentage points, a statistically significant difference.

The analysis was based on data on enrollment in and contributions to retirement plans from the companies themselves. The study used an interrupted time series (ITS) design, analyzing changes in outcomes before and after the implementation of automatic enrollment.
The study found that automatic enrollment increased participation rates. In addition, automatic enrollment led to a larger percentage of participants investing at the plan’s default contribution rate.

Automatic enrollment increased wealth accumulation for those with lower wealth by reducing the percentage of employees who did not participate in the 401(k) plans.","Although all three studies implemented similar interventions, we analyze them as distinct ITS designs because each study employed a different initial 401(k) contribution rate, asset allocation, and eligibility constraint.

These later two interventions were separately considered based on when they subjected employees to automatic enrollment.
Each intervention reviewed here was implemented only one or two times and included an insufficient number of observations before and after the policy went into effect to satisfy Clearinghouse for Labor Evaluation and Research (CLEAR) criteria. Furthermore, employees hired before and after automatic enrollment was implemented faced very different market conditions, potentially influencing the decision to participate in a 401(k) or the contribution rate. Together, these concerns make it difficult to conclude that the observed changes in enrollment rates were driven by the interventions themselves, instead of other concurrent changes.","Company A was a large office equipment company that had about 32,000 employees.

SCEP offers youth job-related counseling, places them in career-related jobs, and supports them through mentoring. The report also describes program implementation and ways of improving SCEP.
The program’s effectiveness was evaluated using a randomized control ed trial. 
The study found statistically significant, positive impacts of SCEP on participants’ employment and earnings over the summer that the evaluation occurred; however, these were not sustained over the one-year follow-up period. 
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this study is high for most outcomes and moderate for the remaining outcomes examined. For the outcomes with high causal evidence, this means we are confident that the estimated impacts are attributable to SCEP, and not other factors. For those with moderate causal evidence, other factors besides SCEP might have contributed to the estimated effects.","","SCEP was created in 1983 to help low-income youth develop the skills necessary to have meaningful careers after high school graduation. Twenty-eight agencies sponsored SCEP at the time of this evaluation, in 1999: 25 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; one in Delaware County, Pennsylvania; and two in Camden, New Jersey. To be eligible for participation, applicants must have: (1) had a family income less than or equal to 150 percent of the federal poverty level; (2) been enrolled in school and completed the 10th grade, or graduated the previous year; and (3) been a first-time applicant to the program.
Participants received preemployment training and were then placed in private-sector jobs identified by SCEP, representing a variety of industries. During the summer, they worked 25 hours a week for at least six weeks, and received the federal minimum wage at the time, $5.15 per hour. They could participate for up to three summers. Participants were mentored by college students of similar background, gender, and race. These mentors served as role models and provided academic, career, and personal advice. Mentors were required to conduct biweekly workplace visits to help facilitate positive work experiences for participants.","The design was a randomized controlled trial of SCEP conducted at 28 sponsoring agencies during the summer of 1999. To estimate the effectiveness of SCEP, the authors used data on about 1,500 youth to compare the outcomes of those randomly selected to receive an offer to participate in SCEP (the treatment group) with outcomes of those not permitted to participate in SCEP until the following summer (the control group). The authors examined the effects of SCEP on employment and educational outcomes using data collected from two surveys conducted in (1) fall 1999, immediately following summer employment; and (2) summer 2000, approximately one year after random assignment. The study also examined outcomes related to likeliness to attend college and attitudes toward work.","The analysis found two positive, statistically significant impacts on employment outcomes of SCEP youth: (1) a larger percentage of youth offered admission to SCEP were employed during summer 1999 than control group youth (92 percent versus 62 percent); and (2) youth in SCEP earned more during summer 1999 than did control group youth ($695 versus $447).
However, among youth who were employed during the summer, SCEP youth earned slightly less per hour than control group youth ($5.30 versus $5.69); this difference was statistically significant.
During the following school year, SCEP youth were much less likely to work for their summer employer than control group youth (32 percent versus 47 percent). However, a larger percentage of SCEP youth had enrolled in a college preparatory curriculum (12 percent versus 8 percent).
No statistically significant differences between SCEP and control youth were found for the mean hours worked (among those youth who were employed) over the summer, the percentage of participants who worked during the 1999–2000 school year, or the hourly wage or total earnings over the school year.","The study was a well-implemented randomized controlled trial for the outcomes measured at the end of the summer and for measures of student enrollment in college preparatory curricula during the following school year. However, most of the outcomes measured at the one-year follow-up suffered from high attrition. The authors included sufficient control variables, including baseline measures of the outcomes and other relevant youth characteristics, to give us confidence that these estimated effects are attributable at least in part to SCEP, although other factors might also have played a role. However, despite this approach, the results presented in the report are based on unadjusted means. Thus, the magnitudes should be interpreted with some caution.","",""

The authors allocated the available vouchers by lottery to eligible families who were willing to participate in the study. Using Unemployment Insurance (UI), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and housing assistance administrative data, as well as baseline and follow-up surveys, the authors compared the outcomes of those randomly assigned to receive a voucher to outcomes of those who were not, adjusting for chance pre-intervention differences between the groups.
The authors found that the Welfare-to-Work vouchers reduced the total number of quarters employed in the first five quarters after random assignment by 0.165 quarters, on average. In the first five quarters, the program reduced total earnings by $325, on average. At the same time, the voucher program decreased the average likelihood of receiving TANF by 1.8 percentage points.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Welfare-to-Work Voucher program and not to other factors.","","The Welfare-to-Work Voucher program aimed to provide low-income families in six study sites with housing assistance to help them successfully transition from welfare to work. Participants received rental assistance vouchers that could be used to rent any unit in the private rental market as long as it met U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development standards and was priced similarly to unassisted units in the same market. Housing agencies could terminate rental assistance if clients did not participate in required work or training activities.","The authors allocated the available vouchers by lottery to eligible families who were willing to participate in the study. Using UI, TANF, and housing assistance administrative data, as well as baseline and follow-up surveys, the authors compared the outcomes of those randomly assigned to receive a voucher to outcomes of those who were not, adjusting for chance pre-intervention differences between the groups.
A total of 8,731 families were randomly assigned into treatment or control groups across six sites. The evaluation had access to administrative data on TANF receipt and benefits amount outcomes for all six sites. The authors assessed outcomes based on UI administrative data.","The study found that the Welfare-to-Work vouchers reduced the total number of quarters employed in the first five quarters after random assignment by 0.165 quarters, on average.
In the first five quarters, the program reduced total earnings by $325.

Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.
The study also reported unfavorable findings (higher Food Stamps receipt) for a subgroup of sites, but data on this outcome were not available for the full group.","Atlanta, Georgia

The analysis was based on administrative data provided by each company. The study used five analyses—one based on an interrupted time series (ITS) design, one based on a randomized controlled trial (RCT), and three quasi-experimental regression analyses—to estimate impacts on 401(k) participation and contribution rates.
The study found that employees’ decision making was influenced by defaults, such as automatic enrollment and automatic disbursements from 401(k) plans. It also found that the gap in 401(k) participation rates between new employees facing a mandatory waiting period for eligibility and those with immediate eligibility disappeared shortly after the former group gained eligibility.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the various 401(k) program designs evaluated in this study. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","","","Study 1. Automatic enrollment was associated with increases in 401(k) participation of 50 to 67 percentage points. Employees were more likely to enroll at the default rate and contribute to the specified automatic enrollment fund when automatic enrollment was in place.
Study 2. Sixty-five to 90 percent of terminated employees with 401(k) balances of less than $1,000 took a cash disbursement compared with only 20 to 33 percent of employees with balances above $5,000.

The authors matched data from unemployment insurance wage records to community college records and used regression models to compare the outcomes of displaced workers who earned community college credits with the outcomes of those who did not.
The study found that long-term earnings among displaced workers increased 9 percent for men and 13 percent for women as a result of one year of community college, and that the effects were largest for those who took quantitative or vocational courses.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is moderate. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the community college course taking, but other factors might also have contributed.","","The program involved typical community college enrollment and participation, with no additional services or enhancements.","The authors matched data from unemployment insurance wage records to community college records to create a database. Unemployment insurance data covered 1987 to 1996 and included earnings, hours worked, hourly wages, employers, and employees’ demographics. The community college data set covered 1989 and 1995 and included information on students’ demographics, courses enrolled and completed, and grades. The authors identified those workers in Washington State ages 22 to 60 with at least three years of paid work experience who were laid off from 1990 to 1994 and had a valid unemployment insurance claim; in total, 97,000 workers fit these criteria. The authors then constructed a treatment group consisting of about 16,000 of those workers who had earned at least one college credit at one of Washington’s 25 community colleges by 1996; the remaining people in the sample comprised the comparison group.
The authors estimated a series of regression models comparing the outcomes of displaced workers who earned community college credits with those who did not. Regression models included time, worker, and time-worker fixed effects.","The study found that long-term earnings among displaced workers increased 9 percent for men and 13 percent for women as a result of earning one year of community college credits.
The effect of community college course-taking on earnings was largest for quantitative or vocational courses, for which earnings increased by 14 percent for men and 29 percent for women. Other courses resulted in little or no increase in earnings.
The authors estimated that about one-third of the increase in earnings was due to an increase in hourly wages and the other two-thirds was due to an increase in the number of hours worked.","The study was a well-implemented non-experimental design. The study authors controlled for many time-variant and time-invariant characteristics of displaced workers that might influence both the decision to complete community college courses and later earnings.","",""

The study reported a steady, statistically significant decline in EtO exposures for the first several years after each OSHA standard was set.
The quality of evidence presented in this study is low. This means we are not confident that changes in worker EtO exposures over time are attributable to OSHA’s implementation of EtO standards.","","The study examined differences in hospital worker exposures to EtO after the implementation of the 1984 and 1988 OSHA EtO standards. The 1984 OSHA standard set a permissible exposure limit of 1 part per million (ppm) and an action level of 0.5 ppm for EtO work shift exposures (time-weighted average parts per million over 8 hours). The 1988 OSHA standard set a short-term excursion limit of 5 ppm for EtO (time-weighted average parts per million over 15 minutes). EtO is a known human carcinogen, a potential reproductive hazard, an allergic sensitizer, a potential asthmagen, and a potent neurotoxin. A large concentration of EtO-exposed workers are in hospitals because EtO is used to sterilize heat- and moisture-sensitive medical supplies.","The authors used a random effects model to examine changes over time in hospital worker exposures to EtO after the implementation of the 1984 and 1988 EtO standards. The model included a random effect for each hospital and examined changes over time in the EtO exposures that exceeded OSHA standards.
The authors used EtO exposure measurements from one of the principal commercial vendors of passive EtO-monitoring devices. This vendor has approximately 50 percent market share and the sample included hospitals in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Work shift measurements were available for 2,265 hospitals, and short-term measurements were available for 1,735 hospitals between 1984 and 2001.","The study found a steady, statistically significant decline in EtO exposures for the first several years after each OSHA EtO standard was set.
Work shift exposures continued to decrease beyond the initial period. However, short-term excursion exposures began increasing in 1996.","This study describes trends over time, but it does not examine the causal impact of the introduction of EtO standards on EtO exposures. It is possible that the changes over time in worker EtO exposures could have occurred without the adoption of OSHA standards, for example, because hospitals adopted alternative sterilization procedures or technologies over time. Because OSHA standards were implemented for all hospitals at the same time, there is no comparison group that was unaffected by the EtO standards and could be used to rule out this possibility.","",""

Earlier reports presented impact findings over a shorter time horizon, and a subsequent report presents impact findings over a longer period (eight years).
For this evaluation, about 2,000 9th-grade students were randomly assigned to the treatment group, which could enroll in a Career Academy, or the control group, which continued to participate in general education. The study team administered a survey to treatment and control group members 48 months after their scheduled graduation from high school.
The study reported statistically significant, positive impacts on average monthly earnings, average hours worked per week, and average hourly wages over the four years following scheduled high school graduation. There were no statistically significant differences in educational attainment of the two groups.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated impacts are attributable solely to Career Academies, not other factors.","","Career Academies were first established some 45 years ago and have become a widely used high school reform initiative. They are designed to keep students engaged in school and improve their employment and educational outcomes. Students apply for admission into Career Academies during 8th or 9th grades (depending on the rules of the program to which they are applying). Career Academies have three distinguishing features, and the study authors pointed out that a true Career Academy must exhibit all three:
They are organized as small learning communities, or schools within schools. They typically serve 150 to 200 students from grades 9 or 10 through grade 12. This smaller size fosters a more personalized learning environment.
The curriculum is organized around one career, occupation, or industry and combines academic and technical aspects relevant to the career.
The academies offer work-based learning experiences, often through partnerships with local employers. These can include summer employment, internships, and mentoring.","The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted in nine high schools located in or near large urban school districts. Districts served a substantially higher percentage of African American and Hispanic students and a higher percentage of low-income families compared with school districts nationally. They also had higher rates of high school dropout and unemployment.
All study participants applied for admission into one of the Career Academies. Because there were more applicants than the programs could serve, a lottery system was used to assign approximately 2,000 applicants to Career Academies. Approximately 55 percent of the applicants were randomly assigned to a Career Academy and formed the treatment group; the rest of the applicants enrolled in general education and formed the control group. The study examined labor market and educational outcomes in the four years following the participants’ scheduled high school graduation dates, approximately eight years after random assignment had taken place.","The authors found statistically significant, positive impacts of Career Academies on average monthly earnings over the four years following scheduled gradation. Career Academies students earned an additional $107 per month, on average, compared with the control group. This increase was due to higher hourly wages and more hours worked per week among the treatment group.
There were no statistically significant differences in any of the educational attainment outcomes between the treatment and control groups. However, high school graduation rates were higher than the national average in both groups.
With regard to gender, impacts were specific to young men; the monthly earnings for young men who attended Career Academies increased significantly—by $212, on average—compared with the young men in the control group. Additionally, Career Academies participation significantly decreased the likelihood of post-secondary education enrollment, from 82 to 76 percent, among young men.","The study was a well-conducted randomized controlled trial. The study’s authors estimated multiple related impacts on labor market participation; performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. Because precise p-values and standard errors were not provided in the report, CLEAR could not confirm whether the main impacts remained statistically significant with an adjustment for multiple comparisons.","Baltimore, Maryland

The program provided hands-on construction training, educational experiences, leadership training, and counseling and other support to youth ages 16 to 24 who had very low incomes (or resided in very low-income households) and had dropped out of high school.
The study examined Youthbuild programs in 20 sites, focusing on program design, grantees’ characteristics, changes in program participants’ outcomes, and costs of operation. The study used program documentation, staff interviews, site visits, participant interviews, and a literature review of other workforce development programs targeting at-risk youth.
The program was successful in enrolling and graduating more participants, and working on more housing units, than planned. More participants held jobs and a high school diploma or general equivalency degree (GED) at program exit than entry. However, many grantees faced implementation challenges.
The authors noted that study results should not be interpreted as generalizable to all Youthbuild program sites because studied sites were only those that received a second round of funding.","","The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) began funding the national Youthbuild program in 1992. From 1996 to 2002, HUD funded 521 grants to 253 program grantees. The program served at-risk youth ages 16 to 24 and sought to provide opportunities for meaningful work and service, educational experiences, and employment skills training. The program also sought to foster leadership skills and a commitment to community development, and to expand the supply of permanent affordable housing for homeless and low-income families (as a result of the construction component). HUD required Youthbuild programs to spend half of their time on hands-on construction activities and the remaining half on other program components, such as educational activities, leadership training, and other support. At least 75 percent of the participants at each site were required to be high school dropouts and youth who had very low incomes or were from very low-income households. The maximum length of participation in the program was capped at 24 months, though participants could still obtain services up to 12 months after completing training. Program grantees were typically local governmental agencies, community- or faith-based nonprofit organizations, and educational institutions.","The study sought to describe the program’s design, grantees’ characteristics, changes in participants’ outcomes, and operating costs. The study drew on three data sources: (1) a literature review on Youthbuild and other youth workforce development programs; (2) an examination of grantees’ records from 128 grantees; and (3) site visits to 20 grantee sites. Site visitors interviewed key program administrators, staff, and some program participants, and collected program documentation. The study included grantee sites in 19 states and the District of Columbia; 17 sites were urban and 3 were rural. To be eligible for the study, sites had to be currently operating grants and have received a grant in the past. Sites were selected to capture variation in funding amount, urban and rural locations, construction type, type of service provider, and the number of units proposed to be built or rehabilitated. The study was conducted from spring 2002 to spring 2003.","Grantees offered a variety of services and activities to program participants. All grantees offered hands-on construction training, educational experiences, leadership training, counseling, and other support activities. Some grantees offered other activities, such as entrepreneurial training and drivers’ education courses. All grantees in the sample included academic training services, but approaches varied. Many sampled grantees offered counseling and substance abuse, pregnancy, violence, and HIV prevention services. Leadership training was delivered in a variety of ways; the authors highlighted student government-like “advisory boards.”
Overall, the study found that effective programs among the sampled sites had strong and dynamic executive directors, program managers, and other leadership staff members. Many grantees faced substantial implementation challenges. Several grantees faced high staff turnover due to uncertain funding and low operating budgets. Some grantees tried to cut costs by stretching beyond the capacity of staff members. Partnerships with other organizations were sometimes frustrating and dysfunctional. The grantees also found it difficult to balance service delivery and housing construction. The authors reported that some sampled programs had to call in professional construction crews to complete projects. Grantees adjusted their expectations to focus on degree and employment attainment, rather than the construction objectives.
Despite these challenges, grantees enrolled and graduated more participants, and worked on and built more housing units, than proposed. More participants held a high school diploma or a GED at program exit than at entry (29 percent compared with 11 percent). An additional 12 percent of participants pursued higher education after the program. The 20 sites placed 36 percent of enrolled participants into jobs; only 9 percent held jobs at entry. Of those employed, 35 percent entered the construction field. New housing built was generally inhabited by the very-low income participants. The study reported that participants faced challenges such as unstable housing, health and behavioral problems, and a number of other risk factors; not being able to meet attendance requirements was the primary reason for program dropout.","The study clearly identified the research topics of interest and explored an array of data sources to explore these topics. It also included a systematic description of findings and effectively illustrated some findings using case studies and descriptive quantitative data from program documents. However, the study did not include a thorough description of the data collection methods, respondents, or analysis methods for site visits. This makes it difficult to determine the extent to which the findings based on site visits reflect the average program experience.

The study used survey data from eight high schools to examine the percentage of AP students who chose a STEM field as their intended college major. The authors compared outcomes for minority and nonminority males and females.
The study found that among students taking AP science or calculus classes, males were generally more likely than females to plan to choose a college major in engineering but less likely to plan to choose a college major in medicine.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is low. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to AP courses. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The AP program was initiated in the 1955–1956 school year as a means for high school students to earn college credit for high achievement in specific subjects. In 2001, the AP program offered 35 courses in 19 subject areas, and more than 90 percent of colleges in the United States offered credit or placement for students with high AP scores. Students can take AP courses in grades 9 through 12, though the majority of AP students are in 11th or 12th grade.","The authors administered a survey to 10 high schools in one school district of an unnamed state in the western United States. Eight schools returned the survey, which contained information on school enrollment as well as individual student responses indicating their planned college majors. A total of 315 students who completed the survey were enrolled in at least one AP course during the 2002–2003 school year. The authors separated the sample into minority and nonminority students who were enrolled in AP science or calculus courses and compared the percentage of females who intended to major in a STEM field to the percentage of males who intended to major in a STEM field.","The study found that among nonminority students taking AP classes in science or calculus, males were more likely than females to plan to choose a college major in engineering, but females were more likely to plan to choose science, math, or medicine: 28 percent of males chose engineering as their planned college major versus 11.6 percent of females. However, 24.4 percent of females chose science or math as their planned major versus 19.2 percent of males, and 20.3 percent of females chose medicine versus 9.8 percent of males.
Among minority students taking AP science and calculus courses, males were more likely than females to plan to choose a college major in engineering, science, and math, but not medicine: 32.3 percent of males planned to choose engineering majors versus 8.3 percent of females; 19.1 percent of males planned to choose science or math versus 13.3 percent of females; but 21.6 percent of females planned to choose medicine versus 16.1 percent of males.","The authors compared females’ pursuit of STEM majors with that of males. These two groups are fundamentally different, so comparing them does not provide evidence of the effect of taking AP courses on females’ pursuit of STEM majors. To provide such evidence, the authors could have compared the pursuit of STEM majors among females taking AP science and calculus courses with that of females who did not have access to AP courses, controlling for relevant characteristics such as age, race/ethnicity, and previous grades in science and math courses.","",""

Other studies examine longer-term impacts.
About 1,100 9th-grade students from 11 high schools were randomly assigned to the treatment group, which could enroll in QOP, or the control group, which could not participate in QOP activities. The study team administered a survey to treatment and control group members about five years after program enrollment (one year after their scheduled graduation from high school) to collect information on high school and postsecondary educational attainment and labor market outcomes.
QOP increased the likelihood that students earned a high school diploma one year after their scheduled graduation by 7 percentage points. No other employment or educational attainment outcomes were statistically significant.

This means we do not have confidence that the estimated effects are attributable to QOP; other factors likely contributed.","Absence of conflict of interest: This study was conducted by staff from Mathematica Policy Research, which administers CLEAR. Therefore, the review of this study was conducted by an independent consultant trained in applying the CLEAR causal evidence guidelines.","QOP was an intensive program comprised of case management and mentoring, education, developmental activities, community service, supportive services, and financial incentives. Services were provided year-round for up to five years to enrollees who had not yet graduated from high school. After high school graduation, participants received some continued mentoring and assistance applying to postsecondary education or training. According to the program model, case managers were to serve 15 to 25 students, and annual participation goals were 750 hours per enrollee who had not yet graduated from high school. For this evaluation, QOP was operated by seven community-based organizations, each affiliated with one to three high schools (11 high schools in total).
Eligibility requirements for students included being in 9th grade for the first time during the 1995-1996 academic year (except at one site, for which the relevant academic school year was 1996-1997) and being in the bottom two-thirds of the GPA distribution for their school in 8th grade. In addition, the students could not be so physically or learning disabled that, according to the school, the program was inappropriate for them.","Students who met eligibility requirements were randomly selected to participate in the study. Those who consented (about 1,100) were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group. The treatment group was allowed to participate in QOP activities, whereas the control group was not.

The authors applied a multiple regression model to panel data from the 1989–1995 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).
The study found that working hours and employment decreased on average among all men with disabilities, regardless of their labor force participation, relative to men without disabilities after the ADA was first implemented in 1992. In contrast, relative working hours and employment increased for labor force participants who self-reported a disability after the law’s 1994 extension went into effect.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not control for possible disparities in pre-intervention trends in working hours and employment among men with and without disabilities. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the ADA; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The ADA prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities. Enacted in July 1990 and first implemented in January 1992, the law bars employers from discriminating against persons with disabilities in all aspects of employment, including hiring, firing, wages, and training. The legislation also requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to help employees with disabilities complete the functions of their jobs, provided the accommodations do not impose undue hardship on the employer. Reasonable accommodations may include adjusting work schedules or equipment, providing qualified readers or interpreters, or modifying facilities to improve accessibility. When the ADA first went into effect in 1992, it applied to government employers and private employers with 25 or more employees; an addendum in 1994 extended coverage to private employers with 15 or more employees.","The authors analyzed a sample of male respondents ages 25 to 59 from four panels of the SIPP, who were surveyed from October 1989 to December 1995. They estimated multiple regression models using sample weights to compare pre- and post-ADA working hours and employment outcomes among men with disabilities to similar outcomes among men without disabilities, distinguishing between the effects of the 1992 and 1994 versions of the law. The models controlled for age, education, race, marital status, region, metropolitan status, and number of children. Individual-level fixed effects were included to account for unobserved characteristics of the men in the sample. To control for selection into the workforce, the authors repeated the analyses on a subsample of men who described themselves as labor force participants.","The study found that working hours decreased on average among all men with disabilities, regardless of their labor force participation, relative to men without disabilities after the ADA was first implemented in 1992.
In contrast, after the law’s 1994 extension went into effect, relative working hours increased for labor force participants who self-reported a disability
After the ADA first went into effect, the probability of employment significantly decreased for men with disabilities relative to men without disabilities, regardless of labor force participation. 
The relative probability of employment among labor force participants who self-reported a disability increased significantly following the ADA’s 1994 expansion.","The authors do not show that trends in pre-ADA working hours and employment rates were similar among men with and without disabilities, either generally or among labor force participants. Therefore, the estimated impacts on working hours and employment might reflect preexisting trends and not the effect of the legislation.","",""

The authors estimated the impact of IPCC on self-reported employment one year after random assignment. Participants who reported that they had either worked at least five days or earned at least $100 in competitive employment in the prior month were classified as employed.","The study found that veterans in the IPCC group were three times more likely to be employed one year after random assignment than veterans in the control group. This difference was statistically significant.","In the model used to estimate program effects, the authors included an indicator for whether a site’s fidelity to the IPCC model was low and that indicator interacted with treatment status. The presence of these terms in the impact model influences the interpretation of the employment impact estimates; specifically, the overall impact of IPCC may be overstated. In addition, although the impact of IPCC was large relative to the control group, the absolute rate of employment in the sample was low, at 8.8 percent.","","1Rosenheck, R., & Neale, M. (1998).

The study used a difference-in-differences model to compare the changes in compensable claim rates for employers that had received WISHA inspections or consultations in the previous year with those that had not received the specific WISHA intervention.
The study found that WISHA enforcement activity was associated with a statistically significant reduction in workers’ compensation claims rates for fixed-site industries (for example, manufacturing) but not nonfixed-site industries (for example, construction).
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this study is low. This means we are not confident that the relative reductions in the compensable claim rates between employers that experienced WISHA enforcement activities or consultations and employers that did not were attributable to the WISHA enforcement activities or consultations.","","The study examined the effects of WISHA inspections and consultations on workers’ compensation claim rates for employers in Washington State. The study analyzed changes in both the annual and quarterly compensable claims rates and examined impacts within fixed-site and nonfixed-site industries.","The study used a regression model to compare the changes in compensable claim rates for employers that had experienced WISHA enforcement activities or consultations in the previous year with those that had not experienced enforcement activities or consultations. The model included controls for employer size and the compensable claims rate from two years before the enforcement activities and consultations. The study separately examined fixed-site industries (for example, manufacturing) and nonfixed-site industries (for example, construction).
The authors used data from the WISHA Integrated Management Information System for 8,929 accounts in the State Fund employer workers compensation program in state fiscal years (SFYs) 1999 and 2000.","The reduction in workers’ compensation claims rates for employers in fixed-site industries that received WISHA inspections was 15.5 percent greater than the reduction for employers that did not receive inspections. This difference was statistically significant. The result did not hold for nonfixed-site industries.
WISHA consultation activity was not associated with statistically significant reductions in the claims rates for fixed-site or nonfixed-site industries.","In SFY 1997—two years before the enforcement activities and inspections, which occurred in SFY 1999—compensable claims rates were almost always higher for employers that later experienced WISHA inspections or consultations than for those that did not experience these events. This suggests that employers that received inspections or consultations could have had more underlying workplace hazards, on average, than employers that were not later inspected. In addition, employers that were inspected had a sharp uptick in claims rates in SFY 1999, which suggests that the change from 1999 to 2000 could reflect mean reversion rather than the effect of inspections. That is, we cannot be confident that any reduction in injury rates after a WISHA activity would not have occurred in the absence of that activity.","",""

Evidence from random assignments in the UI system","The study examined the impact of the Kentucky Worker Profiling and Reemployment Services (WPRS) on Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefit receipt and earnings. 
In this study, about 2,000 UI claimants in Kentucky were randomly assigned to the treatment group, which was required to participate in reemployment services, or to the control group, which was not required to participate but could receive services voluntarily. The authors collected administrative data on UI benefit receipt and earnings for all study participants.
The study found that those in the WPRS treatment group had a statistically significant reduction in UI benefit receipt of 2.2 weeks during the six-quarter follow-up period, compared to the control group. There were no statistically significant impacts of the program on the fraction of recipients exhausting benefits or total UI benefits received.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial (RCT). This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the WPRS and not to other factors.","","At the time of this study, recent UI claimants in Kentucky who did not have a definite recall date and who were not subject to a union hiring hall agreement were assigned profiling scores reflecting their predicted duration of UI benefits. Those with high profiling scores were selected for WPRS and received a letter informing them that they were required to attend reemployment services. Within 10 business days of receiving the letter, claimants had to attend an orientation, where they completed a questionnaire. Staff used the information from the questionnaire to refer each claimant to specific services. Staff referred about 77 percent of claimants to less-intensive job search and job preparation activities (about four to six hours of programming), and 14 percent to more intensive services. Staff could assign claimants to more than one job search activity.","The study included data from people who filed initial UI claims from October 1994 through June 1996. In most cases, the local UI office had enough resources to provide mandatory WPRS to all claimants with high profiling scores., but in some cases there were not enough resources to serve all the claimants with high profiling scores. In those cases, claimants were randomly assigned to receive or not receive the mandatory services. In all, 1,236 claimants were randomly assigned to the treatment group, which was mandated to receive WPRS, and 745 were randomly assigned to the control group, which did not have to participate in WPRS. For each participant in the study, the authors collected UI administrative records from Kentucky for six quarters after random assignment. The authors compared the outcomes of treatment and control members using a regression model that controlled for the time of random assignment, the claimants’ local UI office, and the profiling score. The authors also estimated a regression model that weighted estimates based on random assignment ratios and profiling score groups.","The study found that those in the WPRS treatment group had a statistically significant reduction in UI benefit receipt of 2.2 weeks during the six-quarter follow-up period, compared to the control group. The second estimation method also found a statistically significant reduction.
The first regression model found no statistically significant impacts of WPRS on the percentage of recipients exhausting benefits or on the total UI benefits received. The second model, however, found a 3 percentage point reduction in the percentage of recipients exhausting benefits.
The post-UI claim earnings of treatment group members appeared to be higher among the WPRS group than the control group: $1,054 in the first model, which was not statistically significant, and $1,600 in the second model, which was statistically significant.","Of those referred to services in the treatment group, only 61 percent attended and completed one of the prescribed services. Thirty-two percent of those referred to services in the treatment group did not receive any services. Supplemental analyses showed that the impacts on reduced UI benefit receipt occurred primarily in the first two weeks, corresponding to the period when the letters were mailed to claimants informing them of the requirement to participate in job search activities. Likewise, the earnings impacts were achieved in the first two quarters. These early (pre-service receipt) impacts, together with low participation rates in actual services, suggest that the participation mandate, rather than the reemployment services themselves, was primarily responsible for the impacts.
Because this study took place when the economy was particularly strong, not many local offices were oversubscribed. At offices that were not oversubscribed, all claimants received the treatment services but were not included in this study. The local offices that were oversubscribed and included in the study may not be representative of the full group of offices across the state.","",""

The study contained two experiments in which participants were randomly assigned to either a treatment condition, which received an intervention to alleviate women’s stereotype threat, or a control condition, which did not receive the intervention. The primary outcome of interest was an adjusted score for a study-administered mathematics test consisting of difficult questions from the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), an entry test for graduate school.
The study found that women in the treatment group scored 2.0 to 2.5 points higher on the math test than women in the control condition. These results were statistically significant.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is high because it was a well-conducted randomized controlled trial. This means that we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the intervention, and not to other factors.","","","The study was a randomized controlled trial, including 162 college students in the first experiment and 106 in the second. The study was implemented in mixed-gender groups, but about 70 percent of the study participants were female.
The study focused on two methods for alleviating stereotype threat—that is, the idea that women perform worse than men in mathematics—for female college students. In both experiments, an experimenter, a female in the first experiment and a male in the second, first activated the stereotype threat by telling participants that men generally perform better than women in math. In the first experiment, the female experimenter then distributed one of two types of booklets of GRE math problems to the students. The instructions in the treatment booklets stated that students would be invited to participate in additional experiments later in the semester and that only women could participate in these later experiments because “… women produce more reliable and valid data, comprehend the task requirements better, and produce better results in all types of psychological experiments [than men].” The control test booklets said that students would be invited to participate in additional experiments later in the semester, but made no mention of women’s performance in these experiments or that only women would be invited to participate.
The second experiment had an additional component: before completing the math problems, treatment group members were asked to read a series of four essays focused on women who overcame gender biases and succeeded in various professions, none of which was mathematical or scientific. Control group members also read four brief biographical essays, but they focused on successful corporations, not individuals. Both the experimenters and the study participants were blind to participants’ study group assignment.
In both experiments, researchers analyzed adjusted scores from a mathematics test that included 34 difficult quantitative items from sample GRE tests.","In the first experiment, women in the treatment condition scored approximately 2.0 points higher on the sample GRE math test than women in the control condition, a statistically significant difference.
In the second experiment, women in the treatment condition scored approximately 2.5 points higher on the sample GRE math test than women in the control condition, also a statistically significant difference.","In both experiments, the authors conducted a 2 (sex) x 2 (intervention) analysis of variance (ANOVA) with planned contrasts comparing men and women within the same condition, across conditions, and the interaction between sex and condition for women in the control condition—that is, whether women in the control condition scored worse than the average participant. Because the study was a randomized controlled trial with no attrition, ANOVA is an appropriate analysis; however, the authors did not present the coefficients that isolate the impact of the intervention on women, which is the focus of the Clearinghouse for Labor Evaluation and Research (CLEAR) review. Therefore, CLEAR estimated the intervention’s impact on women by calculating t-tests using the means and standard deviations provided in the study.
The study activated the stereotype that women might perform worse in math for all participants before presenting a strategy to counteract it. Thus, the implications for how such an intervention would work outside the laboratory—in other words, without the artificial activation of the stereotype threat—are unclear.","",""

Under this model, local employers helped to design training programs and provide them in a work-like environment to economically disadvantaged youth who were not in school or employed.
The effectiveness of the CET model in improving employment, earnings, and participation in education and training programs was evaluated using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in 12 sites in seven states.
The study found few statistically significant impacts on outcomes measured over a 30-month follow-up period.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented RCT. This means we are confident that any estimated effects would be attributable to the CET program and not to other factors. However, the study did not generally find statistically significant effects.","","The CET program targeted disadvantaged, out-of-school youth ages 16 to 21. It was first implemented in a site in San Jose, California. Two RCTs conducted in the late 1980s confirmed that CET-San Jose produced positive results for participating youths. Therefore, the U.S. Department of Labor initiated a replication study to discover whether the CET-San Jose model could be implemented successfully in other settings. The CET replication sites agreed to participate in the replication study, and the national CET office in San Jose provided each site with technical assistance.
The CET model has four core features:
It provides occupational and basic skills training in a work-like setting, and trainees advance at their own pace.
It requires a full-time commitment from students, to accustom them to a work schedule.
It maintains close connections to employers, who help design and implement the training programs.
It has an extensive orientation process during which the rigor of the program is emphasized; less motivated individuals may drop out at that point.","The study was an RCT conducted in 12 sites across the country. From 1995 to 1999, the study authors randomly assigned 748 youth to a treatment group eligible to receive CET services and 737 youth to a control group ineligible to receive CET services for 24 months. The authors estimated the effectiveness of the CET program by comparing outcomes of youth in the CET group with outcomes of youth in the control group. The outcomes of interest were employment, earnings, and participation in education and training programs measured up to 54 months after random assignment.","The study examined a number of outcomes related to receipt of education and training, employment, earnings, and public benefits receipt. The study found few statistically significant effects in any of these domains.","In the evaluation’s final, 54-month report, the authors noted that implementing the CET model at the replication sites was challenging. The study reported that only 4 of the 12 sites implemented the model with high fidelity, 6 others implemented the program with medium fidelity, and 2 did so with low fidelity. The authors identified organizational stability as a key feature of successful programs; those that had high turnover in leadership and staff were less successful than more stable programs at sustaining the program model. Difficulty developing close relationships with employers was another challenge to successful implementation.","El Centro, California

The author used regression analyses to compare the effects of sex- and race-based discrimination charges within an industry in a given year on the wages of African American and white women from 1988 to 1996. Data came from the Current Population Survey and the EEOC National Database.
The study found that increases in employment discrimination charges based on sex were positively correlated with increases in wages for both African American and white women. 
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is low because the study did not adequately control for existing differences between the study groups. This means that we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to EEOC enforcement. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, employers are forbidden from discriminating against their employees on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, or national origin. The law prohibits discrimination in terms, compensation, working conditions, and other aspects of employment; mandates enforcement by courts, rather than juries; and provides civil penalties for violations, including mandatory remedial hiring policies for employers and reinstatement with back pay awards to victims. It also created the EEOC to bring class action litigation against employers for discrimination and to resolve individual claims of discrimination. The Civil Rights Act initially applied to private sector employers with more than 25 employees; since 1972, it has applied to those with more than 15 employees.","This study used regression analyses to estimate wages separately for white and African American women and compared the effects of factors related to EEOC employment discrimination charges for each group. These factors, constructed using data from the EEOC National Database, included current and lagged measures of the number of discrimination charges per protected worker and measures of the resolution of the charges (for instance, the percentage with successful settlements). Models included these measures of industry-level EEOC charges on the basis of race and sex separately, as well as year, demographic, and labor market controls. The models also corrected for sample selection bias due to women choosing paid employment based in part on available wages. Results were based on a nationally representative sample of white and African American women from the Current Population Survey March Annual Demographic Files from 1988 to 1996.","The study found that increases in the number of sex discrimination charges within an industry in the current year and each of the lagged years were associated with significantly higher wages for both African American and white women.
The effects of lagged sex discrimination charges were larger for African American women than white women.","The authors did not control for women’s previous earnings history in the analysis, so it is unclear whether women in industries with differing numbers of charges were similar before the filing of charges with the EEOC. For example, women in industries in which more discrimination charges were filed with the EEOC might have tended to be paid lower wages relative to women in other industries. Because the comparability of women across industries with different numbers of charges was not established, the relationship between charges and wages might reflect not only the effect of charges on wages, but also the effects of other factors.","",""

Using school administrative records, the study reports the four-year impacts for students who entered a JROTCCA in the 1994–1995 school year, and one-year impacts for the students who entered a JROTCCA in the 1995–1996 school year, compared with one of three control groups: (1) students in other academy or magnet programs, (2) students in regular non-Career Academy (CA) Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (JROTC) programs, and (3) students in a general academic program. About 27,500 students from eight schools in five urban high school districts participated in the study.
The authors reported several positive impacts of the JROTCCA program, including a reduction in the failure to graduate, substantial increases in the proportion of graduates with high GPAs, and a reduction in the proportion of students with low GPAs, compared with students in non-CA JROTC programs and general academic programs. However, some JROTCCA groups had statistically significantly higher first-year absenteeism rates than their magnet school counterparts.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this study is low because the analysis did not adequately control for characteristics of the students before their entry into JROTCCA. This means that we are not confident that the results estimated in the study are attributable to JROTCCA; other factors are likely to be responsible.","","The JROTCCA program aimed to address the needs of at-risk students and increase their likelihood of graduating from high school. Consistent with the CA model, JROTCCAs are structured as “schools within a school,” with a designated set of students and teachers, block scheduling of student participants to the same CA classes, planning time for teachers, an occupational focus in the curriculum and activities, integrated academic and vocational classes, reduced student:teacher ratios, and local business partners. In addition, JROTCCAs incorporated a JROTC class taught by a retired military instructor that emphasized civic values, citizenship, leadership, and discipline, and offered extracurricular military learning activities.
All 9th- and 10th-grade students considered at risk of dropping out were recruited to participate in the JROTCCA in their school. Students could either self-select into the program or be placed in the program by their parents or guidance counselors.","The study used a nonexperimental design to examine the effects of participation in JROTCCA on high school GPA, high school graduation, and absenteeism. Within each district that housed a JROTCCA program, administrative officials selected similar comparison schools, which, in theory, contained students who were eligible to attend JROTCCA before their assignment to a particular school. The authors used these schools to generate three comparison groups for each cohort of JROTCCA students: (1) students in other academy or magnet programs, (2) students in regular non-CA JROTC programs, and (3) students in a general academic program. The study included 18 cohorts of students across five schools, with a total of 27,490 students participating in JROTCCA or one of the comparison groups.
The authors first predicted the probability of assignment to the JROTCCA program among students in the comparison group(s) within each site. They then used these weights and regression models to estimate the program’s impacts separately for each of the 10 cohorts. In the regression models, the authors controlled for race and ethnicity, gender, school, cohort, prior test scores, prior-year attendance, prior GPA, and prior credits attempted and earned, using data from school administrative records.","The authors reported a 15 to 25 percent reduction in dropout/failure to graduate rates, substantial increases in the proportion of graduates with high GPAs, and a reduction in the proportion of students with low GPAs for participants in JROTCCAs, compared with students in non-CA JROTC programs and general academic high schools.
Six of the 10 JROTCCAs reported significantly higher first-year GPAs than at least one of their control counterparts, with differences ranging from 0.05 to 0.48 points.
Nine of the 10 JROTCCAs reported significantly lower first year absenteeism rates than at least one of their control counterparts, with differences ranging from -4 to -19 percentage points.
However, two of the JROTCCA schools had significantly higher first year absenteeism rates than their magnet school counterparts.","The amount of missing data in this study was high. Baseline math and reading standardized achievement scores were missing for 35 percent of the sample. Baseline data on attendance, GPA, and credits attempted and earned were not available for students that began the JROTCCA program in ninth grade (16 of the 18 cohorts examined). The high degree of missing data implies that, despite the statistical matching techniques the authors used, we cannot be confident that the two groups were well matched on important measures of academic achievement before program enrollment.","",""

The case of the Americans with Disabilities Act.","The study’s objective was to examine the consequences of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) on the employment and wages of people with disabilities.
The main analysis estimated regression models of weeks worked and weekly earnings as a function of self-reported work disability status, allowing effects to differ each year and controlling for factors relating to demographics, region, and time. Data came from the 1988–1997 March Current Population Survey.
The study found that a year after the ADA came into effect (1993), the employment of men and women ages 21 to 39 with disabilities declined and this change could not be explained by potential changes in how individuals reported disability status or by increases in Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Income (OASDI).
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it was based on a well-implemented nonexperimental design. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the ADA, but other factors might also have contributed.","","The ADA prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities. Enacted in July 1990 and first implemented in January 1992, the law bars employers from discriminating against people with disabilities in all aspects of employment, including hiring, firing, wages, and training. The legislation also requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to help employees with disabilities complete the functions of their jobs, provided the accommodations do not impose undue hardship on the employer. Reasonable accommodations include adjusting work schedules or equipment, providing qualified readers or interpreters, or modifying facilities to improve accessibility. When the ADA first went into effect in 1992, it applied to government employers and private employers with 25 or more employees; an addendum in 1994 extended coverage to private employers with 15 or more employees.","The authors estimated regression models comparing weeks worked and weekly earnings of people with and without disabilities, separately by gender and 10-year age groups, before and after the passage of the ADA in July 1992. The models controlled for disability status, demographic characteristics, and region- and year-fixed effects, as well as separate pre-intervention trends in the outcome variable for people with and without disabilities. A set of interactions of disability status with year indicators identified the impact of the ADA on people with disabilities.","The year after the ADA took effect (1993), the employment of men and women ages 21 to 39 with disabilities declined significantly. The change could not be explained by potential changes in how people reported disability status or increases in SSI or OASDI.","The authors controlled for separate pre-intervention trends for people with and without disabilities to help ensure the comparability of the two groups and the validity of the results. The authors also conducted supplementary analyses that supported the main findings. These analyses accounted for receipt of SSI and OASDI benefits for people with disabilities, a factor that can affect employment while also being a consequence of employment status.

The authors compared the outcomes of students who had attended a Career Academy in a large, inner-city school district in California and had applied to a medium-sized state university in California, with those of peers who had graduated from a traditional public high school in the same district and had applied to the same university.
The analysis was based on university records, which provided information on student demographics, high school grade point average (GPA) and college GPA, enrollment status, and major of those students who actually attended the university.
The study found that students from Career Academies had higher GPAs in college and less need for remediation in English at the university level. Students from career academies still had a high need for remediation in math and low college graduation rates, but they graduated at a 4-percent-higher rate than students from traditional high schools.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is low, because the authors did not adequately control for the academic achievement of students before they enrolled in a career academy, nor for students’ pre-intervention financial disadvantage. This means that we are not confident that the results estimated in the study are attributable to Career Academies; other factors are likely to be responsible.","","Career Academies aim to make the high school experience more academically rigorous and relevant to subsequent careers. They achieve this by creating small learning communities; integrating academic and vocational curricula (typically focused around one occupation, profession, or industry); and offering work-based learning experiences, often through partnerships with local employers and post-secondary institutions. Career Academies work with the employers to ensure that the curriculum reflects the employers’ needs, and employers often provide summer work experience and mentoring to Career Academy students.
This study examined Career Academies in one large urban school district on the West Coast. The district first opened a Career Academy in 1985, and by the time of the study, had 12 Career Academies. These varied in their career focus and were at different stages of implementation. Students self-selected into either attending a Career Academy or continuing in an academic, vocational, or general track. The direct costs of the Career Academy were $1,000 higher per student than the standard high school offering.","The study examined several measures of educational achievement, including high school GPA, route to college (including whether the student transferred from another college or university, and whether the student required remediation in math or English), entrance into college, college GPA, and type of exit from the university (graduated, dropped out, or was dismissed). The study had 1,402 participants. All participants graduated from high school between 1990 and 1997 and applied to the university between 1990 and 1998. One-quarter of the applicants to the university from the school district studied had graduated from Career Academies. The authors estimated the effects of high school program track—Career Academy or traditional high school—on these academic outcomes, controlling for student race and gender as well as for high school campus attended.","Students who attended Career Academies had higher college GPAs and less need for remediation in English at the university level than students from traditional high schools.
They had a high need for remediation in math and low college graduation rates, but they graduated at a 4-percent-higher rate than students from traditional high schools.","Students in the Career Academy were self-selected. Characteristics of the students and their families, such as previous academic achievement and degree of financial disadvantage, could shape both selection into the Career Academy and later outcomes, but the study did not control for these. In the absence of these controls, it is likely that the estimates of program effects are confounded by the initial student self-selection into the program.
The university and school district studied had built a strong relationship with one another, to help students successfully transfer from the districts’ high schools to the university. While this relationship minimized the institutional barriers for post-secondary admission for students, the findings from this university may not be relevant in other contexts, where the university does not have the same type of relationship with the school district.","",""

Subsequent reports presents impact findings over a longer period (up to eight years after scheduled graduation).
For this evaluation, about 2,000 9th-grade students who applied to participate in a Career Academy were randomly assigned to the treatment group and admitted into a Career Academy, or to the control group, which continued to participate in general education. The study team administered a survey to treatment and control group members 14 months after their scheduled graduation from high school.
The study reported that participation in Career Academies had no impact on primary educational outcomes, including the likelihood of high school graduation and post-secondary education enrollment over the 14 months following scheduled high school graduation. It also had no impact on employment outcomes, including the likelihood of employment, hours worked per week, or average earnings over this period.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was a well-implemented randomized controlled trial.","","Career Academies were first established some 45 years ago and have become a widely used high school reform initiative. They are designed to keep students engaged in school and improve their employment and educational outcomes. Students apply for admission into Career Academies during 8th or 9th grades (depending on the rules of the program to which they are applying). Career Academies have three distinguishing features, and the study authors pointed out that a true Career Academy must exhibit all three:
They are organized as small learning communities, or schools within schools. They typically serve 150 to 200 students from grades 9 or 10 through grade 12. This smaller size fosters a more personalized learning environment.
The curriculum is organized around one career, occupation, or industry and combines academic and technical aspects relevant to the career.
The academies offer work-based learning experiences, often through partnerships with local employers. These can include summer employment, internships, and mentoring.","The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted in nine high schools located in or near large urban school districts. Districts served a substantially higher percentage of African American and Hispanic students and a higher percentage of low-income families compared with school districts nationally. They also had higher rates of high school dropout and unemployment. All study participants applied for admission into one of the Career Academies. Because there were more applicants than the programs could serve, a lottery system was used to assign approximately 2,000 applicants to Career Academies. Approximately 55 percent of the applicants were randomly assigned to a Career Academy and formed the treatment group; the rest of the applicants enrolled in general education and formed the control group. The study examined labor market and educational outcomes in the 14 months following the participants’ scheduled high school graduation dates, approximately five years after random assignment had taken place.","The authors found no impacts of Career Academies on the likelihood of high school completion or post-secondary education enrollment measured 14 months after scheduled high school graduation. There were small, statistically significant impacts of participation on the likelihood of receipt of a general equivalency diploma (7 percent among Career Academies participations compared with 5 percent among the control group).
There were no statistically significant differences in any of the employment outcomes between the treatment and control groups, including the likelihood of employment, hours worked per week, and earnings.","The study was a well-conducted randomized controlled trial. The study’s authors estimated multiple impacts on educational outcomes and labor market participation one year after expected high school graduation and found only one to be statistically significant. This lack of findings could be attributable to the fairly short follow-up period; subsequent reports from this evaluation found statistically significant differences in labor market outcomes over longer follow-up periods.","Baltimore, Maryland

The authors used Job Corps counselors’ predictions of which Job Corps center applicants would attend before random assignment to compare outcomes of treatment youth with those of comparison youth who would have attended the same centers, had they been randomly assigned a slot in the program.
The authors found few impacts that varied by center characteristics. The impacts of Job Corps were similar across operators; large, medium, and small centers; most regions of the United States; and across high-, medium-, and low-performing centers, as determined by the Job Corps performance measurement system.","","","","","","",""

Job Corps offers intensive academic classroom instruction and vocational skills training to economically disadvantaged youth.
Job Corps’ overall effectiveness was evaluated using a randomized controlled trial—the National Job Corps Study (NJCS)—conducted in 48 states and the District of Columbia (see the Clearinghouse for Labor Evaluation and Research [CLEAR] profile of Schochet et al. 20011 for full results). For this report, the authors used data from the NJCS 48-month follow-up survey to match Job Corps participants to control group members who had similar propensities to obtain a GED or vocational certificate.
The study found that Jobs Corps participants who completed a vocational certificate during the course of the program earned $40 to $50 per week more than their control group counterparts, and those who completed a GED earned $60 to $70 per week more.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is moderate, the highest possible rating for a nonexperimental study. This means that we have some confidence that the estimated impacts are attributable to achieving programmatic milestones in the Job Corps program, although other factors might also have contributed.","","Job Corps is a federally funded program that has been in operation since 1964. It offers individualized academic education, vocational training, counseling, and job placement assistance to economically disadvantaged youth ages 16 to 24. Services are delivered at Job Corps centers, where most Job Corps students reside while participating in the program. Most participants do not have a GED or high school diploma upon program entry and they participate in the program for an average of eight months.","The NJCS was a randomized controlled trial conducted at 119 Job Corps centers in 48 states and the District of Columbia. Eligible youth were randomly selected either to receive an offer to participate in Job Corps immediately or to not be able to participate in Job Corps until three years later (the control group). The study team administered a follow-up survey to both groups approximately 48 months after random assignment to collect data on the outcomes of interest. The sample included about 11,000 youth in total.
Although the official Job Corps study offers the definitive estimates of the average impacts of the program for all participants, this study employs a nonexperimental design to estimate the impact of the program specifically for those participants who earned a high school diploma, GED certificate, or vocational training certificate during the program (approximately 39 percent of the total program group).
The authors employed two nonexperimental approaches to isolate the impacts of Job Corps for those who completed an educational credential during the program. In the first approach, the authors used statistical methods to match Job Corps participants to control group members who had similar likelihoods of completing an educational credential. They then compared the earnings of the matched Job Corps and control group members. In the second approach, the authors tried to isolate the true impact of Job Corps after controlling for individual differences in the likelihood of attaining a credential.","The NJCS reported average earnings impacts of $20 to $25 per week across all those who had been randomly assigned to be offered admission to the Job Corps program. The current study found that almost all of these earnings impacts accrued to Job Corps participants who had completed an educational credential during the program.
Jobs Corps participants who completed a vocational certificate during the course of the program earned $40 to $50 per week more than their control group counterparts; those who completed a GED earned $60 to $70 per week more.","The authors used two nonexperimental methods in this report. The first approach used propensity-score modeling to match Job Corps participants to control group members who had similar likelihoods of completing an educational credential. The groups were well-matched, so this analysis provides moderate causal evidence, the highest rating possible for a nonexperimental design.
The second method involved trying to isolate the true impact of Job Corps after controlling for individual differences between those who completed programmatic milestones and those who did not. However, as noted by the authors, this method did not adequately control for differences between these groups, so it provides low causal evidence.","","1Schochet, P., Burghardt, J., & Glazerman, S.

The findings from the outcome analysis are also presented in two related reports (see CLEAR profile of Maxwell and Rubin [1997] and CLEAR profile of Maxwell [2001]).
The objective of the implementation study was to understand the strengths and challenges of implementing Career Academies. Career Academies share three core features: a school-within-a-school structure, integration of career learning into the high school curriculum, and involvement of local employers in designing the curriculum and providing work-based learning experiences.
The study covered 33 Career Academies across the six high schools in the school district, which ranged in size from 85 to 221 students per academy in the 1994–1995 school year. The authors conducted qualitative analyses of site visit data collected over a nine-year period and interviews with academy directors, high school principals, and academy partners.
The authors reported that the strengths of the program included creating community among academy teachers and students and providing students with experiential learning. The greatest challenges were scheduling academy courses within the constraints of the school and district, gaining support from administrators, and raising enough funds to cover the costs.","","","","","","",""

The study used a regression model to compare differences in injury rates for industries in which higher or lower percentages of the workforce were affected by the four mandatory safety requirements.
The study found that the mandatory safety committee requirements were associated with statistically significant decreases in injury rates; the other three initiatives were not.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this study is low. This means we are not confident that the differences in injury rates between industries in states with the mandatory safety laws and industries in states without these laws are attributable solely to the laws.","","The study examined the effect of four types of mandatory state workplace safety interventions on occupational injury rates in manufacturing industries: (1) employer health and safety program requirements (that is, implementation of written accident prevention programs); (2) employee safety committee requirements; (3) targeted enforcement initiatives directed toward high-accident or high WC claim frequency employers, through either an approved state OSHA department or the state’s WC administrative agency; and (4) state regulation of WC insurance carrier accident prevention services. The study provided estimates for the effect of industry-level OSHA inspections, visits, and fines per 1,000 workers.","The study used a regression model with industry fixed effects to compare differences in injury rates for industries in which higher percentages of the workforce were affected by the four mandatory safety requirements (because they were in states that had implemented the mandatory safety laws) and industries in which lower percentages of the workplace were affected (because they were in states that had not implemented these laws). The model included controls for average firm size, unionization, whether the state had a state OSHA plan, the maximum WC payment, the WC waiting period, the state high school graduation rate, the state unemployment rate, and the percentages of different age groups in the state that were employed.
The authors obtained data on the safety interventions of states and state/federal OSHA by contacting state agencies, reviewing state websites and regulations, and reviewing available literature.

The sample included 3,286 industry-state-year observations from manufacturing industries in 42 states between 1992 and 1997.","Mandatory safety committee requirements were associated with statistically significant decreases in injury rates. 
There was no statistically significant relationship between injury rates and the mandatory loss control, safety program, or targeting requirements.","In this study, the estimated differences in occupational injury rates between industries in states with the mandatory safety laws and industries in states without these laws may reflect underlying differences in safety levels or other factors across states, rather than the impact of the mandatory safety requirements. States chose whether to implement these laws; therefore, states that implemented the laws might have had different injury rates and worker safety levels than states that did not implement the laws.","",""

The study used employee-level data from the company. It used an interrupted time series design to compare the participation and contribution rates of those hired before the company’s 401(k) plan changes to the behaviors of those hired after the changes were implemented. The authors compared employees subject to changes (1) and (2) to those subject to change (2) only and those subject to change (2) only to those subject to neither change.
Employees subject to both immediate contributions and automatic enrollment had higher 401(k) participation rates and lower 401(k) contribution rates than those subject to immediate contributions only. Employees subject to immediate contributions had only slightly higher participation rates compared with those not subject to either plan change.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the company’s changes to its 401(k) plan design. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","","","Employees in the new cohort were 50 percentage points more likely to participate in the 401(k) plan than employees in the window group; employees in the window group were 4 percentage points more likely to participate than those in the old group (who were not eligible for immediate contributions or automatic enrollment).
The average contribution rate for the new cohort was 2 percentage points lower than that of the window cohort.
Increases in participation rates within the new group compared with the window group were greatest for women (50 versus 43 percentage points for men), the youngest employees (57 versus 26 percentage points for the oldest employees), and the lowest earners (67 versus 26 percentage points for the highest earners).","The authors examined a single change in the 401(k) plan of one company. The company implemented automatic enrollment because it did not meet the Internal Revenue Service’s nondiscrimination tests designed to ensure the fair allocation of benefits among higher- and lower-paid employees.

Although OSHA no longer operates as it did during this period, this study provides interesting historical context. The study also contains a descriptive analysis that examined whether OSHA regulatory standards were related to causes of injuries and fatalities (analysis not included in this summary).
The study used regression models to analyze the change in compliance probability between the first and subsequent inspections for a given contractor and for a given contractor at a specific work site. 
The study found that the probability of citation decreased with each additional inspection, with the largest difference between the first and second inspections.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is low. Although the study provides interesting descriptive information, it does not provide evidence of a causal effect of reinspections on compliance behavior.","","OSHA no longer operates as it did during the period of this study. Nevertheless, the study provides interesting historical context. At the time of this study, OSHA inspections were conducted for four reasons: as part of a general schedule of inspections targeted to high-hazard firms; if a complaint had been filed by employees or their representatives; if there had been an injury or fatality; or as a follow-up to a previous inspection. Complaint and follow-up inspections were generally less intensive than general inspections. An inspector could issue citations for violations of safety standards observed during the inspection. Depending on the nature of the violation(s), the inspector might also issue a monetary penalty. Those firms with more violations were more likely to receive subsequent inspections to determine whether the violations had been corrected.
The study examined the change in compliance probability between the first and subsequent inspections. According to the author’s theoretical model, increasing adherence to standards, as measured by increasing compliance probability, should lead to a reduction in outcomes of interest, such as injury rates.","The author estimated regression models to relate the probability of receiving a citation to the sequence of inspections conducted by OSHA. Specifically, the study used a logit model to compare the probability of citation at first, second, and higher-order inspections conducted by OSHA at a given work site from 1987 to 1993. The model controlled for the total number of inspections over the period of interest at all of a contractor’s work sites, whether an inspection was triggered by an employee complaint or a serious accident, the union status of the contractor, an interaction between the complaint inspection indicator and the union indicator, the total OSHA penalties received by the contractor in the past, time spent previously on inspections, contractor size (measured by revenue), and industry- and year-fixed effects.
The author used data from OSHA’s Integrated Management Information System, matched to data compiled from the Engineering News Record’s annual publications (1987–1993) of top U.S. contractors across various segments of the construction industry. The analysis included 2,060 contractors and 27,694 observations at the work site level, with each observation representing an inspection.","The study found that the probability of compliance with all workplace physical-condition standards was 6.3 percent higher during the second inspection than the first. However, subsequent inspections exhibited more modest differences in predicted compliance.
The probability of compliance at a contractor’s other sites was also higher during the second than the first inspection, suggesting spillover effects.","The study’s empirical strategy involved comparing the change in probability of compliance at different sequence numbers of inspections across work sites while controlling for some contractor characteristics. However, important differences between the work sites being compared could have remained. For instance, although the model controlled for the number of inspections across all of a given contractor’s work sites, it did not account for differences in the number of inspections at an individual work site. Work sites inspected once might differ in important ways from those inspected more than once, even within the same contractor. More generally, the compliance probability at work sites can be observed only in those work sites inspected more than once. However, work sites inspected more than once are likely to have different underlying compliance behaviors.","",""

Services are delivered at Job Corps centers, where most Job Corps students reside while participating in the program. Most participants do not have a general equivalency degree (GED) or high school diploma upon program entry and they participate in the program for an average of eight months.","The authors converted the 48-month impact estimates from the National Job Corps Study (see profile of Schochet et al. 20011) into dollar values to determine the monetary value of the benefits of Job Corps. The benefits examined included increased output resulting from the additional productivity of Job Corps participants; reduced use of other programs and services, such as public assistance and substance abuse treatment programs; and fewer crimes committed by and against participants.
The authors used administrative data from the Office of Job Corps to estimate the cost per participant of the program. The costs included operating and capital costs and transfers to students for pay, food, and clothing while in the program.","The study found that the benefits to society of Job Corps exceeded its costs by about $17,000 per participant.
The main driver of the net benefits was increased output resulting from the additional productivity of Job Corps participants. Smaller benefits were conferred by reduced use of other programs and services and fewer crimes committed by and against participants. Total benefits to society were about $31,000 per participant.
The largest costs of the program were operating costs, followed by transfers to students for pay, food, and clothing while in the program, and capital costs. The total cost to society was about $14,000 per participant.","As in any benefit-cost analysis, the assumptions made can influence the findings. The authors provided theoretical grounding for their benchmark analyses and conducted extensive sensitivity tests to investigate the extent to which varying the assumptions varied the study findings. The finding that, on average, the benefits of Job Corps exceeded the costs, was robust to a wide range of plausible assumptions.","","1Schochet, P., Burghardt, J., & Glazerman, S. (2001).

The study used a nonexperimental design, drawing on data from the 1940, 1950, and 1960 decennial U.S. Censuses for 19 non-southern states.
The study found that state-level fair employment laws adopted in the 1940s had larger positive effects on the relative income of African American workers than those adopted in the 1950s. In contrast, laws adopted in the 1950s led to larger increases in African American male unemployment but larger increases in African American women’s labor force participation. Only states that implemented the laws in the 1940s experienced a narrowed income gap between white and African American workers.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the author did not demonstrate that the states that adopted fair employment legislation when they did were comparable to those that did not adopt or adopted at a later time. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to state-level fair employment legislation. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The study assessed the labor market impacts of state-level fair employment legislation adopted by 19 non-southern states. Fair labor laws prohibited employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, creed, and national origin. Before the 1940s, many states had embedded in their constitutions a principle that banned religious discrimination for public officials. Although these principles expanded over time to cover other kinds of government employees and forms of discrimination, it was not until after 1940 that fair employment laws expanding these principles to cover private employment were introduced. The details of these laws varied by state, but they generally included enforcement methods that gave state agencies the power to receive and investigate discrimination complaints, eliminate unlawful discrimination, and issue cease-and-desist orders to noncompliant firms. The first state to adopt fair employment laws was New York in 1945. By 1964, 22 non-southern states had also adopted them.","The study used a nonexperimental design. The author estimated three difference-in-difference-in-differences regression models for each outcome and for men and women separately. Each model examined the impact of state-level fair employment laws adopted in a given decade by comparing changes in native-born African American and white labor market outcomes from the beginning of that decade with the beginning of the next, across non-southern states that did and did not adopt laws in that decade. For instance, the first model examined the impact of laws adopted by four states in the 1940s (Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York) by comparing changes in their outcomes between the 1940 and 1950 U.S. Censuses with changes in three states adopting laws after 1950 (Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania). The second model examined the impact of laws adopted in the 1950s and the third examined the impact of laws adopted from 1940 to 1955.
Each model controlled for individual-level characteristics, including age, education, marital status, and an indicator for metropolitan residence. Outcomes included annual income, unemployment, labor force participation, measures of occupational status, and industry of employment. The data sample included people ages 20 to 59 in the 1940, 1950, and 1960 U.S. Censuses, and was further restricted for the income analysis to full-time workers who were not in school or self-employed.","The study found that state-level fair employment laws adopted in the 1940s had a positive, statistically significant impact on the relative income of African American women, increasing income by 12 percent for African American females relative to white females.
In the 1950s, fair employment laws led to a statistically significant 4 percent increase in African American male unemployment but an 8 percent increase in African American female labor force participation.
Fair employment laws had statistically significant positive impacts on occupational status for African American men throughout the study period, and larger positive impacts on African American women. As an illustration, African American women moved into operatives and craftsmen occupations as well as manufacturing, while African American men moved into manufacturing jobs.","States chose whether and when to introduce fair employment legislation. This choice might have depended on historical trends in African American and white labor market outcomes in the state, as well as prevailing attitudes regarding discrimination. Thus, the estimated impacts could reflect both the effect of relative African American labor market outcomes or discrimination on the timing of adopting fair employment legislation, as well as the effect of the legislation on relative African American labor market outcomes. The author did not account for possible differences in pre-intervention trends between the two sets of states.
In addition, the author estimated multiple related impacts on African American labor market outcomes. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found to be statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The author did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings is likely to be overstated.","",""

In this demonstration, about 20,000 UI claimants were randomized into one of three intervention groups, all of which received some variation of job search assistance services, or into a control group, which could receive existing services in the community. For all participants, the study team collected administrative data, which provided information on UI receipt, earnings, and employment.
The study found that structured job search assistance was generally successful at reducing UI benefits receipt and increasing earnings in Washington, D.C., but not in Florida. The findings for individualized job search assistance treatment groups were less robust.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it is based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the job search assistance strategies tested, and not to other factors.","Absence of conflict of interest: This study was conducted by staff from Mathematica Policy Research, which administers CLEAR. Therefore, the review of this study was conducted by an independent consultant trained in applying the CLEAR causal evidence guidelines.","The Job Search Assistance Demonstration was implemented in one UI benefit office in Washington, D.C., and 10 randomly selected offices across Florida. For each eligible UI claimant, the researchers predicted the probability that the claimant would exhaust his or her benefits based on characteristics including previous occupation and industry, education level, years of tenure at the previous job, and the local unemployment rate. In Washington, those with a predicted exhaustion rate greater than or equal to 60 percent were eligible for the demonstration; in Florida, those with a predicted exhaustion rate greater than or equal to 40 percent were eligible. Eligible claimants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups or a control group.
The three treatment groups were (1) structured job search assistance (SJSA), (2) individualized job search assistance (IJSA), and (3) IJSA plus training (IJSA+). In Washington, about 2,000 eligible claimants were randomly assigned to each of the treatment groups and the control group. In Florida, roughly 3,000 eligible claimants were assigned to each group.
All three treatment groups shared some components, including a required orientation in the sixth or seventh week of unemployment and a one-on-one assessment with UI staff. Participants in all three groups could access the job search resource center and other services provided through Job Service, but they were not required to do so. In addition, the SJSA group was required to attend a 15-hour job search workshop. Those in the IJSA group created an individualized service plan with office staff; the services specified in the plan then became mandatory. Those in the IJSA+ group, like the IJSA group, created an individualized service plan with office staff; this group also received additional information on training opportunities. Those in the IJSA+ group interested in training were referred to the Economic Dislocation and Worker Adjustment Act staff for voluntary training opportunities.
Researchers collected administrative UI benefits receipt data from initial intake into the study (from June 1995 to July 1996 in Washington, D.C., and from March 1995 to March 1996 in Florida) through two years after. Data on employment and earnings came from state UI wage records for 10 follow-up quarters in Washington, D.C., and 12 follow-up quarters in Florida. To measure impacts on UI receipt, earnings, and employment, the authors compared the outcomes of members of each of the three treatment groups with those of the control group.","","The study found that the SJSA treatment group in Washington, D.C., received 1.13 fewer weeks of UI benefits, $183 less in total UI benefits, and had a 5 percentage point lower rate of UI benefit exhaustion in Year 1. However, these effects did not persist into Year 2. This group also had higher earnings over the 10-quarter follow-up period of $2,005, and many quarter-by-quarter earnings comparisons were also favorable for the SJSA group. However, there were few employment rate impacts.
The SJSA treatment group in Florida received 0.41 fewer weeks of UI benefits in Year 1, but this was the only statistically significant impact on UI benefits receipt. The study found no impacts on earnings or employment.
The IJSA treatment in Washington, D.C., had limited impacts on UI benefits receipt: a 0.46 reduction in weeks of benefits received in Year 1. The treatment group had higher earnings of $160 to $190 in quarters 4 through 6, but these did not translate to greater total earnings over the entire follow-up period. There were few differences in employment rates over the follow-up period.
The pattern of results was similar for the IJSA group in Florida: 0.6 fewer weeks of UI benefits received, $100 less in total UI benefits received, and a 2 percentage point lower benefit exhaustion rate in Year 1 than the control group, but no impacts in Year 2 on benefit receipt. In addition, there were no statistically significant earnings or employment impacts.
The rate of UI benefit exhaustion in Year 1 for the IJSA+ group in Washington, D.C., was 4 percentage points lower than the control group, but there were no other statistically significant impacts on benefit receipt outcomes. This group also had higher earnings of $150 to $180 in quarters 2, 3, and 5, but this did not translate into higher earnings over the full follow-up period. There were no statistically significant impacts on employment.
The IJSA+ group in Florida had 0.52 fewer weeks of UI benefits received and a 3 percentage point lower benefit exhaustion rate in Year 1 than the control group. However, there were no statistically significant impacts on UI benefits outcomes in Year 2, no earnings impacts, and an impact on employment in only one of the 12 quarters examined.","The study authors estimated multiple related impacts on UI benefits receipt, earnings, and employment outcomes. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated. In addition, the p-values reported in the study are based on one-tailed tests, which also likely overstates the number of statistically significant findings based on a more appropriate two-tailed test.","",""

The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where 120 active duty military members with TBI were randomly assigned to receive either in-hospital rehabilitation or home rehabilitation. Researchers collected outcome data 8 weeks and 6, 12, and 24 months after randomization.
Although the study authors originally hypothesized that in-hospital rehabilitation would increase the rates of patients who were able to return to work or able to return to active duty, the study found no statistically significant difference between the two groups on these outcomes.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that any differences in outcomes would be attributable to the more effective program; however, there were no statistically significant differences between the programs.","","The in-hospital rehabilitation group combined group and individual therapies that were conducted by board-certified psychiatrists, neuropsychologists experienced in TBI rehabilitation, an occupational therapist, a speech pathologist, and rehabilitation assistants. All therapies were delivered in a hospital setting and included a protocol-driven routine of physical fitness training and group and individual cognitive, speech, and occupational therapies.
In the home rehabilitation group, patients and their families received TBI education and individual counseling from a psychiatric nurse. Patients and their families received educational materials and strategies for improving cognitive and organizational skills, were trained in number and card-game exercises, and were encouraged to watch the news and read books and magazines. They received weekly 30-minute telephone calls from the nurse, who advised on issues and inquired about the week’s events.","The study was conducted at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. from January 1992 through February 1997. The evaluation consisted of a randomized controlled trial in which 120 patients were deemed eligible to participate in the study and consented to participate. To be included in the study, participants had to meet the following inclusion criteria: (1) diagnosed as having moderate to severe TBI; (2) sustained head injury in the three months before random assignment; (3) cognitive level of 7, as determined by the Rancho Los Amigos cognitive level scale; (4) active duty military member; (5) stable home setting with at least one responsible adult available; (6) ability to walk/move about independently; and (7) no previous severe TBI or other disability that would prohibit return to active duty after treatment.
Eligible patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Sixty-seven received in-hospital rehabilitation and 53 received home rehabilitation. Data for the evaluation were collected from multidisciplinary evaluations (including interviews, military records, and medical records) that occurred 8 weeks after randomization as well as re-evaluations at 6, 12, and 24 months. Outcomes of interest included patients’ return to gainful civilian or military employment and fitness for military duty. The study also assessed measures of quality of life, which included belligerence, social irresponsibility, antisocial behavior, social withdrawal, and apathy. The authors estimated the relative effect of the programs by comparing the means of the groups on each of these measures.","Although it was originally hypothesized that in-hospital rehabilitation would increase the rates of patients who were able to return to work or active duty, there was no significant difference on these outcomes between the two groups. In addition, no significant differences were found in any of the quality-of-life outcomes.","The study was a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. However, the study sample was small, making it difficult to detect statistically significant differences in outcomes. In addition, because the study contrasted two types of treatment, we cannot infer how effective either treatment would be when compared to receiving no treatment. Finally, because this study focuses on active military members, the study’s results might not hold for civilians.","",""

The study also included an impact evaluation of student outcomes (see CLEAR’s profile of Maxwell [2001] for impact evaluation results).
The Career Academy model created a school-within-a-school structure, with both school-based and work-based elements, for students who were in grades 10 through 12. The program sought to increase students’ knowledge and skill acquisition in high school, continuation rates onto higher education, employment rates and wages, and capacity for lifelong learning.
The study drew on qualitative data from the program’s annual evaluations of district and program performance and on student characteristics, program participation, and outcomes.
The qualitative study found that although the program succeeded in articulating a uniform model of school-to-work program throughout the district, schools and academies differed in their development and implementation of this model. These differences were due to the political, community, and funding environments of these organizations.","","The urban school district that was the focus of this study had high poverty rates (20 percent of the population were in poverty), a very diverse population (90 percent of students belonged to ethnic or racial minority groups), and lagging educational outcomes that were well below the national average. These conditions motivated the city and district to articulate a uniform model of school-to-work programs throughout the district. This model created a school-within-a-school structure, integrated academic and vocational curricula, and involved employer representatives to provide curriculum guidance and exposure to work-related activities.
The district's model had both school-based and work-based elements. The school-based component required students of grades 10 through 12 to take four classes (three academic and one laboratory class) per grade that integrated curricula or material from the target industry. The work-based component required students to complete an internship in the summer after their junior year, as well as to participate in a number of visits and workshops to learn about the educational pathways to highly paid jobs. The program aimed to improve student outcomes by (1) increasing knowledge and skill acquisition in high school, (2) increasing students' continuation rates onto higher education, (3) increasing employment rates and wages, and (4) laying the foundation for lifelong learning for students to continue to build careers and increase human capital.","The study examined an urban school district's attempt to develop and implement a uniform education-centric Career Academy model between 1990 and 1997. It focused in particular on nine Academies. These were diverse in their structure, size, age, the degree to which they were able to access external financial support, and their progress in model implementation. The process study drew on a rich array of existing qualitative data collected as part of the program’s annual evaluations of district and program performance, as well as on quantitative data on student characteristics, participation, and outcomes.","The study found that the program succeeded in articulating a uniform model of school-to-work program throughout the district, and helped increase the number of Career Academies and career-preparation activities for students. However, schools and Career Academies differed in their development and implementation of this model. These differences were due to the political, community, and funding environments of these organizations.
City Redevelopment Agency (CRA) funds to establish, expand, and enhance Career Academies were key to successful model implementation. Additional funding for the programs came from the school district, the state government, federal government, local government and municipal government. The study implied that schools’ access to these additional resources became more important over time: the CRA budget did not increase despite the growth in program enrollment, reducing the per-student allocation from an average of $2,910 per student in 1990–1991 to an average of $574 in 1995–1996.
Schools’ socio-economic status appeared to be correlated with the completeness of program implementation, but the relationship was not linear. Schools with mostly middle-income students had the strongest Career Academies, because they had strong pressure for reform but also sufficient staff capacity for implementation. Schools with mostly low-income students lacked resources, funds, and capacity, whereas schools with high socio-economic status were resistant to integrating a vocational focus in their academic curriculum.
The Career Academies had mixed results securing student participation in the program. 80 percent of students taking designated curriculum classes were enrolled in the Career Academies, and Academy students on average took 13 Academy semester courses. Only 23 percent of program participants met the ""full academic curriculum"" benchmark of taking 20 courses. Only 28 percent of participants enrolled in all three sophomore, junior, and senior years as required. Fewer than 60 percent enrolled in both junior and senior years.","The study was effective in presenting both the impetus for program development and the theoretical framework for the intervention, and in using these to guide the presentation of findings and results. The study effectively combined qualitative and quantitative data to provide an assessment of program development and implementation. However, a lack of detailed information on the qualitative data collection methods and analysis techniques could raise concerns that the analysis may be somewhat subjective or selective. It is possible that others who review the data may arrive at different conclusions.","",""

Using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation from 1985 to 1995, the author compared the change in employment for men with disabilities ages 18 to 65 pre- and post-ADA with the change in employment for men without disabilities over the same period.
The study found that the employment rate for men with disabilities was 8 percentage points lower relative to men without disabilities after ADA, with particularly large differences for those with mental disabilities or low education levels.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is low. This means that we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the ADA; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The ADA prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities. Enacted in July 1990 and first implemented in January 1992, the law bars employers from discriminating against persons with disabilities in all aspects of employment, including hiring, firing, wages, and training. The legislation also requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to help employees with disabilities complete the functions of their jobs, provided the accommodations do not impose undue hardship on the employer. Reasonable accommodations may include adjusting work schedules or equipment, providing qualified readers or interpreters, or modifying facilities to improve accessibility. When the ADA first went into effect in 1992, it applied to government employers and private employers with 25 or more employees; an addendum in 1994 extended coverage to private employers with 15 or more employees.","The author used employment and demographic data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation to compare pre- and post-ADA employment rates for men with and without disabilities ages 18 to 65 overall and within groups defined by education level, age, and disability type. The model accounted for differences in occupation, industry, minority status, duration of disability, and whether the disability resulted from injury, but the exact model specification was not given.","Overall, the employment rate for men with disabilities was significantly lower relative to men without disabilities after ADA than before ADA by 8 percentage points.
The effect of ADA was particularly acute for men with mental disabilities. Compared with men without disabilities of the same age, the employment rate of men with mental disabilities was significantly lower by more than 20 percentage points after ADA than before ADA.
Men with disabilities and low education levels were significantly less likely to be employed than men without disabilities of the same age and education level. From 10 to 20 percentage points fewer high school dropouts with disabilities were employed after ADA than before ADA, relative to high school dropouts of the same age who did not have disabilities.","The author provided little information about the data or methods used, limiting the extent to which CLEAR can evaluate the validity of his conclusions. For instance, the author did not examine or control for different trends in outcomes for men with and without disabilities in the years leading up to passage of the ADA. Differences in employment trends before the passage of ADA, for example, could have driven differences in employment after it. For this reason, the study did not demonstrate that changes in the employment of men without disabilities presented a valid picture of what would have happened to the employment of men with disabilities in the absence of the ADA.
In addition, the analysis might not have captured the full effect of the law. The author defined the pre-intervention period as 1985 to 1990, the year in which the ADA passed. Although the law did not go into full effect until 1992, it is likely that organizations began preparing to meet their additional obligations under the ADA immediately following its passage. It also could be the case that firms began making adjustments even earlier based on expectations that the ADA would be passed. Thus, the comparison treated trends that arose in response to ADA as part of the control period, masking the law’s true effect.","",""

They administered a survey to the centers with the highest and lowest retention rates, and they conducted focus groups, interviews with program staff and participants, and observations of service delivery at five Job Corps sites.
The authors’ analysis of characteristics and survey responses found that students with certain characteristics—for example, older students, those who entered the program with more advanced educational attainment, and those who interacted more closely with admissions counselors at Job Corps centers—were more likely to remain in the program. However, the authors noted that these were not highly reliable predictors of whether a student would remain in the program, suggesting unobserved factors played a role as well.
The qualitative analysis of focus groups, interviews, and observations indicated that the students’ motivation, emotional maturity, and interpersonal skills and the strength of the relationships between participants and staff were important determinants of retention. Based on these findings, the authors recommended launching a staff training initiative to ensure staff were prepared to communicate effectively with students, challenge them, and build their sense of connectedness with one another and the program.","","","","","","",""

The Center for Employment Training (CET) model targets economically disadvantaged youth who are not in school or employed. It delivers training in a work-like environment, requires full-time participation, and involves local employers in program design and delivery.
The analysis assessed the fidelity of implementation to the CET model using qualitative data collected during site visits to 12 sites and preliminary administrative data from 8 sites.
The study found that all the replication sites were generally successful in structuring services to mirror the workplace. Sites operated by CET (8 of 12) had overall higher fidelity to the model than non-CET-operated sites. Additionally, the study suggested that organizational capacity and stability are critical to replication; the 7 replication sites led by less-experienced organizations were prone to upheavals, and 4 closed during the course of the evaluation.","","The CET program targets disadvantaged, out-of-school youth ages 18 to 21. CET was started in San Jose, California, in 1967, and two randomized controlled trials conducted in the late 1980s confirmed that CET-SanJose produced positive results for participating youth. By 2000, the program had expanded to 35 sites in 14 states. The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) initiated a replication study to determine whether the CET-San Jose model could be implemented successfully in other settings. The CET replication sites agreed to participate in the replication study and the national CET office in San Jose provided each site with technical assistance.
The CET model has four core features. First, it provides occupational and basic skills training in a work-like setting, and trainees advance at their own pace. Second, it requires a full-time commitment from students, to accustom them to a work schedule. Third, it maintains close connections to employers, who help design and implement the training programs. Fourth, it has an extensive orientation process, during which the rigor of the program is emphasized; less motivated individuals may drop out at that point.","The evaluation of the CET replication included both an implementation and impact study. The interim report profiled here focused on whether the replication sites had faithfully implemented the CET-San Jose model and how they adapted it to local circumstances. Of the 12 participating sites, 6 were in Eastern and Mid-Western sites that participated in the study through a DOL grant application process: Orlando, FL; Chicago, IL; Reidsville, NC; Camden, NJ; Newark, New Jersey; and New York, NY. Six were Western sites randomly selected from within CET’s existing network of programs: El Centro, Oxnard, Riverside, San Franciso, and Santa Maria in California and Reno in Nevada.
Data sources for the implementation study include (1) semistructured interviews with site directors, training instructors, support counselors, job developers, and participating youth during two rounds of site visits; (2) observations of training activities; (3) written materials that describe program operations and background; and, (4) preliminary participation data from CET’s management information system for the CET sites covering closed cases through June 30, 1999.","The study found that CET replication sites differed greatly from one another and from the original CET-San Jose site on contextual elements such as unemployment rates, racial and ethnic composition of the local population, and population density. Five of the 12 sites had highly stable organizational capacity based on funding and staffing. These organizations had been in place for at least 20 years at the time of the study and had developed close ties to funders and employers within their local communities to weather challenges. Replication sites led by less-stable organizations were prone to upheavals, and 4 of the 7 closed during the course of the evaluation.
Replication sites were generally faithful to the CET model in structuring services to mirror a work-like environment and the design of services. Although 10 of the sites adopted curricula that required intensive participation—a key aspect of the program model—eight of the 12 sites were rated as having low fidelity to this aspect of the program model, largely due to high program dropout rates. Only half of the sites successfully involved industry representatives. In terms of overall fidelity to the CET model, the study found that CET-operated sites (8 of 12) had higher fidelity than sites not operated by CET, and sites that had been operating CET longer tended to be more faithful to the model.
Based on the preliminary administrative data, of 365 youth randomly assigned to CET in 8 of the 12 sites before June 30, 1998, 68 percent enrolled in training. On average, youth enrolled in training received 630 hours of training over 26.6 weeks (or 186 days). For all program group members (including those who did not enroll in training), the average hours of training were in the range of 428 to 510 hours. The amount of training received by program youth compared favorably with other large-scale youth training demonstration programs and with mainstream Job Training Partnership Act programs; however, program youth received less training than that experienced in the original CET-San Jose site.
Based on the qualitative analysis, many sites, particularly the less mature sites, had difficulty finding and maintaining full-time staff positions for job developers, making the job placement assistance element of the model one of the more difficult to replicate successfully. And, although most sites implemented programs consistent with the major elements of CET, some programs could not be sustained. The authors suggested that future attempts to replicate the CET model should consider organizational capacity and stability as critical factors affecting program sustainability and consider providing more extensive financial support.","The reporting of qualitative information by respondents and the definitions used by researchers were somewhat subjective. It is possible that different definitions of the measures could produce different results. The study appropriately acknowledged that variation in the selection of the CET sites produced a sample split between early implementation sites and steady-state, mature programs that inhibited the ability to make generalizations across the study sites as a whole.","",""

The Journal of Human Resources, 37(1), 144-158.","","https://clear.dol.gov/study/changes-wage-discrimination-against-people-disabilities-deleire-2000","","2000","Low Causal Evidence","Topic Area: Employer Compliance","Causal Impact Analysis","Regression Analysis","Changes in wage discrimination against people with disabilities.","The study’s objective was to estimate changes in wage discrimination against people with disabilities before and after the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). 
The author used data from the 1984, 1992, and 1993 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation to compare earnings for people who reported functional and work limitations, people who reported only functional limitations, and people who reported no limitations. The percentage of the gap between the first two groups that was not explained by control variables and self-reported health status was attributed to discrimination, and that percentage was compared between 1984 and 1993 to estimate the effect of the ADA.
The study found earnings gaps between people with no disabilities and those with work limitations and/or functional limitations in each year, and the share of the gap explained by discrimination rose slightly after passage of the ADA.
The quality of causal evidence provided in this study is low. This means that we are not confident that the estimated effects were attributable to the passage of the ADA; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The ADA prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities. Enacted in July 1990 and first implemented in January 1992, the law bars employers from discriminating against persons with disabilities in all aspects of employment, including hiring, firing, wages, and training. The legislation also requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to help employees with disabilities complete the functions of their jobs, provided the accommodations do not impose undue hardship on the employer. Reasonable accommodations may include adjusting work schedules or equipment, providing qualified readers or interpreters, or modifying facilities to improve accessibility. When the ADA first went into effect in 1992, it applied to government employers and private employers with 25 or more employees; an addendum in 1994 extended coverage to private employers with 15 or more employees.","This study examined the effect of the ADA on the share of the disability wage gap explained by discrimination rather than by health status, productivity, or other factors using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation. Using a wage decomposition procedure, the author first compared wages of people who reported both functional and work limitations to those of people without those limitations to determine the extent of wage differences that were unexplained by individual-level demographic, self-reported health, and job-related control variables. (Functional limitations were defined as difficulties with an activity of daily living and could include wheelchair or long-term cane use.) The unexplained differences could be attributed to both productivity differences and discrimination. Second, by estimating a similar model comparing wages of people who reported only functional limitations to those of people without functional limitations, who are assumed to have similar productivity at work, the author identified the extent of wage differences due to discrimination only. The gap in the wage differences computed from the two models could then be attributed to productivity differences.
The author compared the percentage of the wage gap between workers with and without limitations that was attributed to discrimination between 1984 and 1993 to assess the effect of the ADA on discrimination. The analyses were based on data from all states.","The study found that the earnings of workers with both functional and work limitations were significantly lower than those of workers without those limitations by about 28 percent in 1984 and 42 percent in 1993. The earnings of workers with only a functional disability were significantly lower than those of workers without a functional disability by about 8 percent in 1984 and 10 percent in 1993.
In 1984, 5 percent of the disability wage gap was attributed to discrimination. In 1993, 8.1 percent of the disability wage gap was attributed to discrimination. This increase suggested little impact of the passage of the ADA in 1990 on the extent of wage discrimination against persons with disabilities.","This study relied on a number of assumptions about the comparability of the groups analyzed in terms of productivity and disability status. If these assumptions were not met, the percentage of the wage gap attributed to discrimination might be biased either up or down. For example, the study assumed that people with both functional and work limitations did not have more severe disabilities than those with only functional limitations. If their disabilities were more severe, it might be inappropriate to assume they faced the same levels of wage discrimination. In addition, the study assumed that a person with a functional limitation but no work limitation was no different in terms of productivity than a person with neither limitation after controlling for self-reported health status. If functional limitations had an effect on productivity at work beyond the effect of work limitations, it might be inappropriate to assume that the unexplained difference in wages between those with only functional limitations and the those with no limitations reflected only the effect of discrimination.","",""

The authors randomly assigned eligible unemployed individuals to either a treatment group, which could participate in JOBS II, or the control group, which could receive other services in the community, but not JOBS II. The study included a pre-test two weeks before the intervention and follow-up questionnaires 2, 6, and 24 months after the intervention.
The authors found that JOBS II was associated with positive effects on the treatment group’s rate of reemployment and monthly earnings as measured two years after assignment, compared with the control group.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the study was a randomized controlled trial with unknown attrition and lack of sufficient controls in the analysis. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the JOBS II program; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The JOBS II program consisted of five four-hour morning sessions over the course of a week covering job-search skills, including identifying and articulating job-related skills, using social connections to find job leads, reaching out to employers, preparing applications and resumes, and interviewing.
In addition to teaching job search skills, the intervention focused on the mental and emotional well-being of participants. For example, a component of the program involved teaching problem-solving skills designed to help participants anticipate setbacks and adapt when they arose. Male-female pairs of trainers who were unemployed high school teachers, educational counselors, and social workers also searching for work at the time led the sessions.","The authors conducted a randomized controlled trial, with participants recruited from four unemployment compensation offices across southeastern Michigan. The recruitment process limited the study to individuals receiving or applying for unemployment compensation. Researchers further screened out those who were new entrants to the labor market, had been unemployed for more than 13 weeks, were already reemployed, only accompanying others in line, on strike, expecting to be recalled for work in the next few months, or planning to retire in the next two years. Individuals were also excluded if they expressed a preference for the treatment or control condition, expressed no interest in participating in either condition, or scored very highly on an assessment of depression. Eligible individuals were randomly assigned to either a treatment group, which could participate in JOBS II, or a control group, which could access other services in the community but not JOBS II.
Researchers administered a pre-test two weeks before the intervention began and three post-test questionnaires 2, 6, and 24 months after the intervention. Analyses were based on 1,430 study participants who completed the two-year follow-up questionnaire. The authors used statistical models to compare the long-term employment, earnings, and hours worked of treatment and control group members, adjusting for baseline age, gender, education, family income, race and ethnicity, marital status, and indicators of psychological well-being.","The study found that being offered access to the JOBS II program was associated with, on average, 55 percent higher odds of being employed after two years.
The treatment group on average spent more time employed at least 35 hours a week (0.06 more months) during the two years after the intervention in which participants worked more than 35 hours.
Two years after the intervention, the treatment group worked an additional 4 minutes and 48 seconds per week and earned an additional 7 cents per month compared with the control group.","The authors did not provide sufficient information in the study to calculate attrition and, given the study’s age, CLEAR did not attempt to obtain it. Therefore, the study was reviewed as a nonexperimental design. Although the analyses included controls for baseline age, gender, race and ethnicity, marital status, family income, and psychological well-being, studies must also include a control for pre-intervention earnings measured more than one year before random assignment. Therefore, the study is not eligible for a moderate causal evidence rating.","",""

The authors examined trends in the annual employment shares of African American men, African American women, white men, and white women at employers in different size classes. They also assessed the contributions of individual- and firm-level factors to the gaps in wages earned by African American and white workers over time. Analyses used March Current Population Survey Annual Demographic Survey (1964–1988) linked with County Business Pattern data.
The authors estimated that the Civil Rights Act and affirmative action increased the share of African American men and women employed by large firms. In addition, the authors found that a substantial proportion of African American–white wage convergence during the study period was attributable to African American employees’ growing employment share at large firms.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low. This means that we are not confident that the observed changes in employment are attributable to the Civil Rights Act and affirmative action; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, employers are forbidden from discriminating against their employees on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, or national origin. The law prohibits discrimination in terms, compensation, working conditions, and other aspects of employment, mandates enforcement by courts, rather than juries, and provides civil penalties for violations, including mandatory remedial hiring policies for employers and reinstatement with back pay awards to victims. It also created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to bring class action litigation against employers for discrimination. The Civil Rights Act initially applied to private sector employers with more than 25 employees; since 1972, it has applied to those with more than 15 employees.
Affirmative action Executive Order 11246, signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965, reinforced prohibitions in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and earlier executive orders against discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin; subsequent Orders and revisions have added sex (1967) and sexual orientation and gender identity (2014) as protected classes. Order 11246 required the federal government and federal contractors with 50 or more employees or $50,000 in contracts to develop written affirmative action plans and ensure equal opportunities for all workers. The Order authorized the Secretary of Labor to establish the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs to enforce federal contractors’ compliance.","This study estimated the impact of the Civil Rights Act and affirmative action executive orders, which apply disproportionately to larger employers, on the growing representation of African American and female employees at large firms during the post-civil rights period of 1964–1988. In addition, because large employers typically pay more than small employers, the authors attempted to identify the share of African American–white wage convergence during this period that was attributable to the shifting share of African American employment at large firms.
The authors matched characteristics and counts of private sector, full-time, full-year workers ages 18 to 64, obtained from the March Current Population Survey, to employers by state, industry, and year, as identified from the 1963–1987 County Business Patterns data. They first compared the percentage of employment at small employers (defined as less than a certain threshold, the level of which varied from 20 to 100) relative to large employers, for African American and white men, African American and white women, and white women and men. Analyses estimated employment shares overall and after controlling for differences in employee characteristics, including education and North/South geographic location. They then computed the proporations of the change in wage gaps that were attributable to changes in wage disparities between African American and white workers over time into components explained by changes in human capital, employment at large versus small firms, and other factors.","The study found that, following the Civil Rights Act and affirmative action executive orders, the employment distribution of African American men and women relative to their white counterparts reversed dramatically, from 13 to 16 percent over-representation at small firms in the early 1960s to 10 percent under-representation at small firms by 1975. The reversal was apparent even after controlling for education and potential work experience. This trend was particularly apparent in the South, where pre-1964 employment discrimination was known to be higher. However, the authors did not indicate whether these findings were statistically significant.
In addition, a substantial proportion of African American–white wage convergence during the period could be explained by African American employees’ growing employment share at large firms. For example, an estimated 15 percent of the wage convergence between African American and white men in the South and an estimated 20 percent of the wage convergence between African American and white women in the South were attributable to African American employees’ growing representation at large employers. However, the authors did not indicate whether these findings were statistically significant.","The authors identified the effect of the policies by comparing workers at large employers, which were affected by the policies being examined, to workers at small employers, which were not affected. However, the analysis did not establish that small employers were comparable to large employers before the passage of these laws. Although the authors controlled for worker and firm characteristics, African American and female employment trends at small and large employers may not have been comparable before 1964, so subsequent changes in employment may not have been due solely to the implementation of the policies. The authors also did not address the fact that establishment size was under employers’ control. Some employers (for example, those that found it desirable to have a relatively small share of African American employment) might have kept their establishment size low to avoid being subject to the policies.","",""

The study used a matched comparison group design to compare ISC participants with nonparticipants. Data sources included administrative data from Parkland College and interview and survey data.
This study found that ISC students earned significantly more credit hours than comparison students.

The study had two parts: a pilot study in spring 1998 and the full implementation in fall 1998 and spring 1999. In the pilot study, the ISC model (or ISC II) integrated four three-credit hour classes: Critical Comprehension Skills (CCS) 098, English 098 or 099, Literature 120, and Orientation 101. Pilot study participants included all students enrolled in the spring 1998 ISC. In the full implementation study, the ISC II model continued to apply to the spring 1998 ISC participants. The third phase of ISC (or ISC III) consisted of four integrated courses: English 099, Math 094, Psychology 101, and CCS 099. Participants in the full implementation included students who enrolled in the second and third phases of ISC (ISC II and ISC III). In both ISC phases, study participants met regularly (three days each week) with their instructors.","The study used a matched comparison group design to compare ISC participants with nonparticipants. Students in the comparison group were enrolled in traditional, nonlearning community versions of the developmental reading courses that were part of the learning community. The study used multivariate regressions and t-tests of mean differences to estimate impacts on credit hours. The author did not conduct statistical tests for course completion or persistence outcomes.","Overall, ISC students earned 1.5 more credit hours than comparison students. Students in ISC III earned 3.5 more credit hours than those in the CCS 099 comparison group. These differences were statistically significant.","The study used a matched comparison group design to compare ISC participants with nonparticipants. However, for only one eligible outcome did the author conduct any statistical tests: credit hours earned. The author did not conduct statistical tests for the other two eligible outcomes: course completion and persistence. The author estimated impacts on credit hours, controlling for age, race, pre-intervention reading achievement, and gender. The regression model did not control for a measure of participant’s degree of financial disadvantage. This raises the concern that pre-existing differences between the groups, rather than ISC, could account for the observed differences in outcomes between treatment and comparison students.","",""

Using labor force statistics derived from the Current Population Survey and other sources, the author used an interrupted time series design to estimate the occupational status of black men relative to white men from 1958 to 1981, specifically focusing on differences after the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The study found a positive trend in the occupational status of African American men relative to white men over the entire 1958–1981 period and a larger positive trend for years after 1964. The author estimated that about half of the rise in relative earnings for African American men from 1964 to 1981 could be attributed to increased occupational status.

Annual data came from several sources, including the Current Population Survey and U.S. Census. Occupational status was measured by the share of African American men in high-wage occupations: specifically, a relative index of the distribution of African American to white men across 11 exhaustive occupational categories weighted by median earnings for the occupations. The fully specified model included an overall time trend, a post-1964 time trend, and controls for average national economic conditions and relative African American–white schooling, employment, and population. In addition, the author estimated the extent to which changes in the earnings of African American men relative to white men could be attributed to occupational status by regressing a measure of relative earnings on occupational status, controlling for a time trend, cyclical economic conditions, relative human capital, and relative civilian employment.","The study found a significant positive trend in relative African American occupational status in the post-1964 era, compared with the 1958–1964 era. The proportion of African American men in higher-status occupations relative to white men increased an average of 0.5 percent per year from 1965 to 1981.
The author attributed about half of the increase in earnings for African American men from 1965 to 1981 to increases in the occupational status index.","The author compared the outcomes of African American and white men measured before and after the Civil Rights Act of 1964. CLEAR’s guidelines require that authors study multiple demonstrations of the same intervention in an interrupted time series analysis, in order to limit the chances that changes in outcomes reflect some other factor that changed at the time of the intervention. Because the Civil Rights Act was implemented on the national level, there was only one demonstration of the intervention, and we cannot be confident that the estimated effect was due solely to this legislation. This is an inherent limitation of using an interrupted time series analysis to study the effects of a national policy change.","",""

This review was conducted in collaboration with the Employment Strategies for Low-Income Adults Evidence Review (ESER). Because ESER did not report findings for studies that received a low causal evidence rating, this CLEAR profile does not report the findings either.

The Ramsey County variation of MFIP combined the financial incentives of MFIP with a work-first orientation, requiring people to participate in a sequence of activities to encourage rapid employment. The financial incentives included generous earnings disregard when calculating eligibility for cash assistance, direct payment of child care expenses to the child care provider (rather than as a reimbursement to participants), and combined cash assistance and Food Stamps payments. Participants receiving welfare for a year or more who did not qualify for “good cause” exemptions were required to participate in a job search workshop and seven weeks of supervised job search activities. Job search workshops included guidance on the job search process, career exploration, resumes, interviews, and workplace challenges. During the seven weeks of supervised job search, participants were required to spend 30 hours per week (or 20 if they had a child younger than six years old) searching for jobs. Participants with part-time employment totaling fewer than 20 or 30 hours per week were required to engage in job search activities to bring their total to 20 or 30 hours per week. Failure to complete these activities could result in sanctions.

The authors randomly assigned families to MFIP-R or existing services (AFDC). AFDC did not offer the financial incentives offered by MFIP-R and required fewer job search activities. The authors compared employment, earnings, and receipt of benefits between the MFIP-R and AFDC groups, accounting for differences in prior employment, earnings, and welfare receipt in their analysis.","This review was conducted in collaboration with the Employment Strategies for Low-Income Adults Evidence Review (ESER). Because ESER did not report findings for studies that received a low causal evidence rating, this CLEAR profile does not report the findings either","The random assignment process was compromised in this study because some treatment group members who did not attend their scheduled recertification meeting were mistakenly reassigned to the control group. To remove these sample members from final analyses, the authors dropped people who did not receive payments in the month after random assignment, which could have inadvertently excluded more than just the misassigned study participants. This issue made it important that the authors account for pre-existing differences between the treatment and control groups in their analyses. However, the authors did not account for potential baseline differences in groups on age, race and ethnicity, gender, employment, and earnings more than one year before random assignment, although they did account for employment, earnings, and welfare receipt during the year directly before random assignment. This means that the estimated impacts could reflect differences in the characteristics of the two groups in addition to any effects of MFIP-R.
The higher amount of welfare received by the treatment group is notable because the intent behind the program was to reduce dependence on public assistance. However, MFIP-R provided participation incentives in the form of public assistance, which could account for the higher amounts in the treatment group during the first year.","",""

Later reports present impacts on transitions to post-secondary education measured 14 months after scheduled graduation and employment and earnings four and eight years after scheduled graduation.
For this evaluation, about 2,000 9th-grade students who applied to participate in a Career Academy were randomly assigned to the treatment group and admitted into a Career Academy, or the control group, which continued to participate in general education. Data sources for this report include school transcript records, student surveys, and standardized math and reading tests.
This study reported a statistically significant, positive impact on the number of vocational classes taken and credits completed to graduate, but no impacts on standardized test scores, dropout rates, or the proportion of students who applied to college or for a job.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated impacts are attributable solely to Career Academies, not other factors.","","Career Academies were first established some 45 years ago and have become a widely used high school reform initiative. They are designed to keep students engaged in school and improve their employment and educational outcomes. Students apply for admission into Career Academies during 8th or 9th grades (depending on the rules of the program to which they are applying). Career Academies have three distinguishing features, and the study authors pointed out that a true Career Academy must exhibit all three:
They are organized as small learning communities, or schools within schools. They typically serve 150 to 200 students from grades 9 or 10 through grade 12. This smaller size fosters a more personalized learning environment.
The curriculum is organized around one career, occupation, or industry and combines academic and technical aspects relevant to the career.
The academies offer work-based learning experiences, often through partnerships with local employers. These can include summer employment, internships, and mentoring.","The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted in nine high schools located in or near large urban school districts. Districts served a substantially higher percentage of African American and Hispanic students and a higher percentage of low-income families compared with school districts nationally. They also had higher rates of high school dropout and unemployment.
All study participants applied for admission into one of the Career Academies. Because there were more applicants than the programs could serve, a lottery system was used to assign approximately 2,000 applicants to Career Academies. Approximately 55 percent of the applicants were randomly assigned to a Career Academy and formed the treatment group; the rest of the applicants enrolled in general education and formed the control group. The study examined aspects of the students’ engagement in high school during the three to four years following random assignment, as well as their preparation for post-secondary education and employment.","Across the full study sample, Career Academy students were 23 percentage points more likely to complete three or more career or vocational courses (67 versus 44 percent) and 6 percentage points more likely to complete the credits required to graduate (65 versus 59 percent) than students in the control group, although there was no difference between the groups in completing core academic course requirements.
There were no statistically significant differences between Career Academy and control group students on most other outcomes examined, including the dropout rate, standardized math and reading test scores, and the proportion who applied to college or for a job.
For the subgroup of students identified as being at a high risk of dropping out at the time of random assignment, the authors found statistically significant impacts of Career Academies on three of four measures of credit accumulation and two of five measures of course-taking, but no differences in reading or math achievement. In addition, high-risk Academy students were less likely to drop out of high school (21 versus 32 percent) than control group students, and a higher proportion applied to college (51 versus 35 percent).","The study was a well-conducted randomized controlled trial. The authors estimated multiple related impacts on academic progression and performance; performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. Because precise p-values and standard errors were not provided in the report, CLEAR could not confirm whether the statistically significant impacts remained so after adjusting for multiple comparisons.","Baltimore, Maryland

The authors used statistical models to compare two distinct treatment groups to a comparison group within each state. The treatment groups both received PLX job search assistance, a job referral, and a job offer; one group did not actually work at the position offered while the other did. The comparison group received job search assistance but not PLX job referrals or placements. The authors used data from the Oregon Employment Department and the Washington State Employment Security Department.
The study found that individuals in the treatment group tended to receive UI benefits for fewer weeks than individuals in the comparison group; this was a statistically significant difference.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not ensure that the groups compared were similar before the intervention. This means we are not confident that the estimated relationships are attributable to PLX job referrals or placements; other factors are likely to have contributed.","Absence of conflict of interest.","PLX services were offered as part of the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933. State employees through federally funded state employment security agencies implemented the PLX services.
PLX services included in-person or over-the-phone job search assistance, workshops, access to resource rooms that provide computers to prepare resumes, phones to communicate with employers, newspaper classifieds, online job boards, and a job and career planning library. Individuals could have identified promising job listings and been referred to a job. Individuals could have then pursued interviews for those jobs, completed the interview process, and received and accepted job offers. An individual was considered to have received a placement if he or she actually worked at the position offered. PLX was available to anyone in the state, and individuals can access these job openings in person or online.
In addition to these services, PLX placed requirements on UI claimants to ensure they were seeking employment and offered services to employers, such as listing job openings and hosting job fairs.","This study is a nonexperimental analysis that included 138,280 unemployment spells among the 58,980 individuals who received UI benefits in Oregon in 1995, and 328,815 unemployment spells among individuals who received UI benefits in Washington between 1987 through 1995. Using data from the Oregon Employment Department and the Washington State Employment Security Department, the authors compared the duration of UI benefit receipt among the unemployment spells of two treatment groups with the duration among the unemployment spells of the comparison group. The treatment group members received PLX job search assistance, a job referral, and a job offer; those in one treatment group did not actually work at the position offered, while those in the other treatment group did. The comparison group members could have received PLX job search services but did not access job listings or receive a referral to a job. In their statistical models, the authors controlled for age, race, gender, and earnings or occupation before the intervention. Individuals could have multiple unemployment spells during the study period, so the analysis included multiple data observations for some individuals. Analysis took place separately by state.","Benefit receipt: Individuals who received PLX job referrals but did not actually work at the position offered tended to receive UI benefits for about one-fifth of a week less in Washington but about two-thirds of a week more in Oregon relative to the comparison group. Individuals who received PLX job placements tended to receive UI benefits for about two weeks less in Oregon and about four weeks less in Washington relative to the comparison group. These were statistically significant differences.","The authors did not account for existing differences between the groups before receiving PLX job referrals and placements. Individuals in each treatment group, all of whom received a job referral and offer, may differ from individuals in the comparison group in unobservable ways. These existing differences between the groups—and not the PLX job referrals or placements—could explain the observed differences in outcomes.","",""

The study used a nonexperimental design to compare the UI benefit receipt, employment, and earnings outcomes of WPRS participants in six states to the outcomes of similar UI claimants who did not receive WPRS. The main data source was state UI administrative records for nearly 457,000 UI claimants.
The study found that WPRS reduced UI benefit weeks and amounts in three of the states during the benefit year. However, there were few statistically significant impacts on employment rates or earnings in the four quarters after the initial claim, and some of the impacts were in an unexpected direction.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate, because it is a well-implemented nonexperimental study. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to WPRS, but other factors might also have contributed.","Absence of conflict of interest: This study was conducted by staff from Mathematica Policy Research, which administers CLEAR. Therefore, the review of this study was conducted by an independent consultant trained in applying the CLEAR causal evidence guidelines.","In 1993, Congress amended the Social Security Act to require states to establish a system to identify which UI claimants are most likely to exhaust all eligible benefits, in order to offer them services earlier in their unemployment spells and track their progress toward reemployment. In this study, UI claimants were identified and selected for referral to WPRS through a two-step process. First, UI claimants with a definite recall date or an exclusive union hiring hall agreement were screened out. Among those remaining, each state employed a statistical method to identify claimants at high risk of exhausting their UI benefits. The exact method differed across states, but the probability of exhausting benefits typically was predicted as a function of claimant characteristics, such as education and previous job tenure, characteristics of the local economy, and, in some cases, measures of claimants’ previous earnings.
WPRS services were intended to be individualized; in most states, however, they included a 30- to 60-minute orientation that explained WPRS participation requirements. This orientation could be followed by a required group workshop (typically lasting four or fewer hours) that provided labor market information, training in job search methods, referrals to job openings, and help preparing job application materials. Some states also required profiled claimants to meet one-on-one with an employment counselor to assess each claimant’s interests and aptitudes and, in some cases, to develop an individualized service plan.","This nonexperimental study assessed the effectiveness of WPRS in six states: Connecticut, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, New Jersey, and South Carolina. The treatment group was made up of claimants who were identified as having a high probability of benefit exhaustion and were referred to WPRS services. The comparison group was made up of claimants who were initially screened for WPRS but not referred to WPRS because of capacity constraints or local area discretion. The authors estimated the impact of WPRS services as the regression-adjusted differences in outcomes of 155,047 treatment group members and 301,920 comparison group members. Impact models were run separately for each state and typically controlled for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, job tenure, industry, and occupation of previous job; earnings in pre-UI receipt base period; state unemployment office; calendar quarter of initial claim; and maximum benefit amount.","The study found that WPRS significantly reduced the average weeks of UI benefits received in Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, and New Jersey by 0.25 to 0.98 weeks. This translated into statistically significant reductions in the average total amount of UI benefits received in Illinois, Maine, and New Jersey from $64 to $139. 
In addition, WPRS significantly reduced the proportion of claimants who exhausted all available benefits in Connecticut, Maine, and New Jersey by 1.4 to 4.3 percentage points. However, WPRS increased the proportion who exhausted benefits in Kentucky by a statistically significant 4.1 percentage points.
WPRS seemed to have few impacts on employment. The exceptions were New Jersey, where WPRS reduced the probability of employment in each of the four quarters following the initial claim, and South Carolina, where WPRS reduced employment in the fourth quarter after the initial claim, in each case by a small but statistically significant percentage.
In addition, there were few impacts on earnings. Statistically significant, positive impacts on earnings were found for Maine in the first quarter and New Jersey in the second quarter after the initial claim. However, WPRS reduced earnings for South Carolina participants in the fourth quarter after the initial claim.","The authors noted that WPRS-referred claimants were from 1 to 45 percentage points more likely than nonreferred claimants to receive at least one service beyond orientation, with a particularly large impact (as high as 42 percentage points) on the percentage attending a job workshop or job club. Nevertheless, the authors noted that the inconsistency of the labor market and UI benefit receipt impacts, as well as the variation in labor market impacts across states and during follow-up periods, provides little evidence of a strong, consistent WPRS effect.","",""

TCAP students achieved higher grade point averages, earned more credits, and had higher attendance rates than students in general academic programs. Outcomes for TCAP students were not statistically significantly different, however, from those for magnet school students.
The quality of causal evidence in this study is low because the authors did not adequately control for the academic achievement of students before they enrolled in TCAP. This means we are not confident that the results estimated in the study are attributable to TCAP; other factors are likely responsible.","","In the mid-1990s, the Los Angeles County Unified School District collaborated with the Los Angeles Community College District and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority to implement TCAP, a Career Academy that would introduce students to careers in the Los Angeles transportation industry. To implement TCAP, the district assigned a core team of teachers, administrators, and support staff to form learning communities in three high schools. Students in 9th and 10th grades identified as at risk of dropping out were invited to enroll. The curriculum included a survey course that served as an introduction to the transportation industry, industry-related electives, summer internships, industry mentors, and field trips. Each of the three TCAP programs was well established by the time of the evaluation.","The authors used administrative school district records to compare the outcomes of TCAP students in three high schools with two comparison groups drawn from the same three high schools and/or three similar schools in the same district: one comparison group included students enrolled in magnet programs in five of the six high schools, and the other comparison group was composed of general education track students in all six of the high schools.

Outcomes for TCAP students were not statistically significantly different from those for magnet school students.
The authors noted that pre-intervention baseline standardized achievement test scores were highest for the magnet school students, followed by the TCAP students, followed by the general education students.","The study authors attempted to control for students’ pre-enrollment achievement, as measured by test scores, but these data were unavailable for more than half the study sample. For those for whom it was available, TCAP students had statistically significantly higher test scores than general education students.

Initiated in 1964, Job Corps provides comprehensive education and employment skills training to disadvantaged youth ages 16 to 24.
The study drew on survey, administrative, and qualitative data to present students’ and Job Corps centers’ characteristics across the full population of participating students and centers in 1996; sampling for site visits excluded noncontiguous states. This study was part of the National Job Corps Study that also included an impact evaluation and a benefit-cost analysis.
Job Corps united federal agencies, private contractors, and unions in implementing a training and support model for disadvantaged youth. Job Corps centers generally implemented core service components with consistency. Links between outreach and admissions counselors to Job Corps centers, and job placement services, proved challenging.
Findings are generally applicable to program implementation nationally; however, the study did not measure outputs such as content or quality of services, participation, or dosage.","","The Job Corps program was funded by the U.S. Department of Labor and began in 1964. It targeted disadvantaged youth ages 16 to 24. Eligible youth must have been economically disadvantaged (demonstrated through receipt of welfare or food stamps) and in need of education or training to gain meaningful employment. Job Corps provided basic education, vocational skills training, health care and education, counseling, and residential support through 110 Job Corps centers located in 46 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Job Corps served slightly fewer than 40,000 students at any one time in 1996. Most students resided at Job Corps centers while in training, though 12 percent of students were nonresidential. Implementing agencies were state employment security agencies and other state and local agencies, and some private organizations.","This process study described the Job Corps model, examined implementation, and identified variations in program elements or characteristics across centers and administering agencies that could affect students’ outcomes. The study was conducted in late 1995 and throughout 1996 as part of a broader study that included an impact analysis. The process study used four data sources: (1) a telephone survey of outreach and admissions counselors in 536 of 556 (96 percent) district offices; (2) in-depth site visits to 23 Job Corps centers in 20 states (selected through a stratified random sample); (3) a mail survey of all 110 Job Corps centers (with a 100 percent response rate); and (4) Job Corps administrative data on students’ characteristics and program experiences for 69,118 students who terminated from Job Corps in 1996. Data for the study were drawn to represent students’ characteristics and Job Corps centers’ characteristics across the full population of participating students and centers in 1996; however, sampling for on-site visits excluded noncontiguous states. This study was part of the National Job Corps Study that included an impact evaluation and a cost benefit analysis.","The study concluded that Job Corps had a well-developed program model that was implemented as planned. The study’s authors concluded that Job Corps students received intensive and meaningful training and services. Findings focused on three areas: outreach and admissions, center operations, and placement. The study found eligibility screening to be effective; youth were rarely found ineligible based on discretionary criteria, such as capacity to benefit from the program. Students typically entered Job Corps with substantial academic deficits. Outreach and admissions counselors had limited direct knowledge of the centers. Their average tenure was short and few had prior experience with Job Corps. As a result, students did not always have accurate perceptions of the program when they arrived at centers.
Job Corps offered a uniform program structure and content, but was flexible in shaping vocational training to individual’s interests and local industry needs. Job Corps followed a distinctive open-entry, open-exit approach to vocational training to allow for individualized and self-paced instruction for students with differing needs. Job Corps offered training programs in more than 75 vocational areas, but 80 percent of training slots corresponded to the 10 largest vocational areas (with the highest projected demand for workers). The program gradually adjusted trade offerings in response to changes in employers’ demand. Experiential learning occurred at centers or through employers’ placements; a computer-based instruction system provided uniform curriculum and delivery of academic courses, though some centers offered supplemental courses or approaches. Remedial education improved literacy and numeracy skills of students. Residential living was a distinctive program component and residential counselors provided key social and personal supports and were effective in retaining at-risk students. Gender and ethnic composition was similar between students and staff, so students could work with staff of their own gender and ethnicity. The physical condition of centers’ facilities varied substantially because Job Corps had taken over facilities built for other purposes (such as military barracks and hospitals). Respondents said that improving dormitory facilities, especially for women, would improve student retention. The behavior management system, which rewarded good performance and sanctioned poor performance, effectively encouraged positive behavior among students. The expanded zero tolerance policy for drugs and violence also appeared to improve behavior and the general center climate.
Social skills training was generally viewed as valuable to youth, but it needed improvement in curriculum content and facilitator training. Progress and Performance Evaluation Panels assessed students’ performance in all program areas and guided each student in ongoing self-assessment and goal-setting processes. The evaluation system was seen as useful by staff and valuable by students, but suffered from inconsistent implementation and administrative burden. The performance bonus system, which granted pay bonuses based on performance ratings, was viewed as subjective and inequitable. Job placement agencies, national contractors responsible for helping former students obtain jobs, rarely met students in person, which limited the provision of comprehensive placement services. The centers and contractors lacked coordination of services, and contractors were not building linkages with employers to support placement.","This was a carefully designed, systematic study of the national Job Corps program. The data sources and methods of selection and sampling make the findings generally applicable to implementation of the program as a whole across the country. The findings were descriptive in nature and useful in identifying the variation in implementation that occurred across centers, and in identifying potential strengths and weaknesses in implementation (though these were not necessarily highlighted in study findings). The study was not focused on the measurement of outputs such as content or quality of services, participation, and dosage.","",""

They also administered a survey to 1,600 Academy and non-Academy students at those sites.
The analysis of interview and survey data found that students at sites with a formalized structure for collaborating with employers, a coordinator for the employer partnerships who did not have teaching responsibilities, and structured orientations on experiential learning participated in a wider variety of career preparation activities than did students at sites without these features.
Academy students had higher levels of participation in career-related activities than non-Academy students and were also more likely to be working in jobs related to their occupational studies in the Academy.","","","","","","",""

Created by the Social Security Administration (SSA), Project NetWork tested specific approaches to improving employment among Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) recipients and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) applicants and recipients, with a particular focus on case and referral management systems. 
The study used multiple data sources, including the Master Earnings File (MEF), Master Beneficiary Record (MBR), Supplemental Security Record (SSR), and survey data collected 25 to 36 months after enrollment.
The study found that Project NetWork increased earnings one and two years after enrollment, but these effects did not persist in the third follow-up year. The program led to a slight increase in the average number of months employed, but no changes in participants’ Social Security disability benefit receipt, health, or well-being.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is considered high for the annual earnings, proportion of months receiving SSI/SSDI benefits, and average monthly SSI/SSDI benefits outcomes measured through administrative data because they are based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial with low attrition. However, the quality of causal evidence is moderate for annual earnings, hours and months worked, and mental and physical health outcomes due to high attrition for these domains.","","Project NetWork was created by SSA in 1991 to test specific approaches to improving employment among Social Security disability benefit recipients, with a particular focus on case and referral management systems. The goal was to help Social Security disability benefit recipients achieve improvements in health status, functional ability, and motivation to work, which in turn would have positive impacts on employment outcomes. Four case and referral management delivery systems were tested, all of which included counseling, follow-up, and support services but differed in terms of whether SSA, vocational rehabilitation, or private disability organization staff implemented the services. This study examined the program from 1993 to 1996.
SSDI recipients and SSI applicants and recipients in eight demonstration sites were eligible to receive Project NetWork services, regardless of age, type of disabilities, and other factors, as long as they had not previously participated in a return-to-work program. In total, 8,248 participants who volunteered to receive Project NetWork services were randomly assigned to a treatment group receiving case management services or to a control group. To increase the incentive to work, participants in both treatment and control groups were also given waivers of certain SSI and SSDI program rules. Specifically, SSDI recipients had 12 months of earnings exempted from the calculation of the trial work period (TWP), while those who had already completed their TWP did not have their benefits suspended for earning above the substantial gainful activity amount. SSI recipients who earned more than $500 a month were exempt from a medical continuing disability review for 12 months.","The study used two key data sources—administrative data and interviews. It used three SSA administrative data files to measure impacts: (1) the MEF, which included annual earnings information; (2) the MBR, which provided SSDI participation information; and (3) the SSR, which provided SSI participation information. The study also used in-person interviews with participants in the treatment and control groups, conducted at baseline and 25 to 36 months after random assignment, to measure program impacts on outcomes such as health and the numbers of hours worked.

Individuals with eligible profiling scores were assigned an orientation session, during which they would complete a questionnaire to determine which type of services best suited the needs of the individual. Individuals were deemed “job ready” because they had job skills, were willing to obtain a job with wages lower than their previous position, and had employable skills.

The authors randomly assigned workers in three sites to either the treatment group, which could participate in the workplace literacy program, or the control group, which was barred from participating in the program for a period of time. The authors estimated impacts of the program by comparing outcomes of the two groups, controlling for the probability of their participation.
The study did not find any statistically significant effects of the workplace literacy programs on GED attainment, employment, average weekly earnings, or standardized literacy assessments.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high for most outcomes because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we have confidence that any estimated effects would be attributable to the workplace literacy programs studied and not to other factors; however, the study found no statistically significant effects.","","The workplace literacy programs studied were funded by the National Workplace Literacy Program (NWLP), a federal demonstration grant program that awarded funds from 1988 to 1994 to organizations and employers running workplace literacy programs. These programs taught literacy and other basic skills to workers, with a focus on skills needed for work tasks. Often businesses and community partners worked together to develop and run the programs. This study focused on three NWLP sites funded in 1994 whose eligibility and program features varied.
Site 1 offered about 66 hours of formal in-class instruction (English as a Second Language or basic skills courses) and provided child care, job and family counseling, and referral services to primarily female, Asian immigrants working in the garment industry. The program operated on weekends and was run by community organizations (no employers were involved).
Site 2 offered employees of a metal processing company 40 hours of instruction in five core courses: (1) Foundation Skills, (2) Communication for the ’90s, (3) Team Survival Skills, (4) Applied Math, and (5) Learning to Learn. It also provided a learning lab to supplement skill development with computer-based instruction, a resource library, help from tutors, and access to the adult high school diploma and GED® test preparation programs the county adult education program offered. Classes took place at the plant during working hours. A community college and literacy organization were involved in the partnership.
Site 3 provided 60 hours of instruction in classes implementing a competency-based curriculum designed for the program that included 42 competencies in two levels of English language skills. Participants were primarily Hispanic immigrants who worked in agriculture or food manufacturing. Classes took place at work sites immediately after the work day. The lead partner was a nonprofit employment and training organization.","The authors evaluated the workplace literacy programs using a randomized controlled trial with data from a purposive sample of sites. These sites were selected because they used features thought to be crucial for successful programs. Sites were also selected based on willingness to adhere to random assignment, willingness to use a standardized literacy test, and ability to recruit sufficient participants. Lastly, sites were selected because they represented a range of partnership models.
The authors selected five sites overall and conducted the randomized controlled trial at the three sites with local partnerships. Workers who applied to the program were grouped by program staff based on their literacy scores and/or location. If workers had not previously participated in a program course, the authors randomly assigned them within groups to either the treatment group, which could participate in the workplace literacy program immediately, or the control group, which could participate after a delay of 16 to 28 weeks (the length of delay varied by site). In all, 409 eligible workers were randomly assigned to the treatment group (260) or control group (149). Impacts were estimated by examining the difference in outcome rates across the treatment and control groups for each of the sites.","The study did not find any statistically significant effects on GED attainment, employment, average weekly earnings, or standardized literacy assessments.","Two of the three sites experienced high attrition for the standard literacy assessment outcomes; therefore, these outcomes cannot receive a high causal evidence rating. However, because the authors included sufficient controls in their analyses of these outcomes, they receive a moderate causal evidence rating. This means that for these outcomes at these two sites, we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the workplace literacy programs, but other factors might also have contributed.","",""

The study used a non-experimental design that used regression analysis for impact evaluation. The author used data from the 1968–1980 Current Population Survey (CPS).
This study found that the 1972 EEOA had positive impacts on the employment, earnings, and occupational status of African American men in the South in industries with more than 50 percent of workers employed in small establishments covered by the law.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is moderate because it was based on a strong non-experimental design. This means we are somewhat confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the 1972 EEOA, but other factors might also have contributed.","","Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, employers are forbidden from discriminating against their employees on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, or national origin. The law prohibited discrimination in terms, compensation, working conditions, and other aspects of employment, mandates enforcement by courts, rather than juries, and provides civil penalties for violations, including mandatory remedial hiring policies for employers and reinstatement with back pay awards to victims. It also created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to bring class action litigation against employers for discrimination. The 1972 EEOA extended the coverage of federal civil rights laws under Title VII from employers with 25 or more employees to employers with 15 to 24 employees. More restrictive state laws could have applied to firms with fewer than 25 employees.","The author aimed to identify the effects of the 1972 EEOA by examining men who were likely working for small establishments (that is, establishments with 25 or fewer employees) in 14 mostly Southern states that did not have state fair employment practice laws covering employers in small establishments in 1972. The author compared this group with men likely working in larger establishments in these 14 states and men likely working for small establishments in other states, none of whom would be affected by the EEOA’s passage. These other states typically had existing fair employment practice laws covering employers with fewer employees than those covered by the EEOA. Because employers’ size could not be directly observed, the author created three industry groupings based on the percentages of employees in each industry working in small establishments affected by the law. Men who were likely working for small establishments were defined as men employed in industries in which more than half of the workers were in private sector establishments with 25 or fewer employees. Men who were likely working for small establishments in the 14 intervention states were newly covered by civil rights protections in 1972.
The study estimated difference-in-differences (DD) models and difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) models using data from the March, May, and October monthly CPS surveys from 1968 to 1980. Study participants were male workers ages 16 to 65. The DD and DDD models contrasted men working in industries with higher and lower employment in small establishments before and after 1972. The DDD model additionally compared differences between the 14 Southern states and other states. Study outcomes included African American male employment share, African American–white male relative annual earnings, and African American–white male relative employment in broad occupational groups. The employment models controlled for region-specific industry effects, region-specific year effects, African American–white relative demographic characteristics, and pre-policy time trends in each industry group by region. The earnings gap equation controlled for education, potential labor market experience, marital status, full- or part-time status, veteran status, central city residence, and metropolitan residence.","The study found that African American male employment shares in affected industries and states increased by 0.5 to 1.1 percentage points more per year than in the comparison group.
The ratio of African American to white earnings narrowed by 10 to 17 percentage points in affected industries and states relative to previously covered industries and states.
African American men experienced statistically significant gains in occupational status as a result of the 1972 EEOA: a greater share of African American men than comparable white men gained employment in clerical, sales, craft, and operative occupations after the law’s passage.","The study was a well-conducted non-experimental design, but there are shortcomings to using 1979 CPS data for defining the treatment and control groups. For instance, the data reported only establishment size categories, so workers employed in establishments with fewer than 15 employees (who were not covered by the 1972 EEOA) were not distinguished in the data from those employed in establishments with 15 to 24 employees (who were covered). Thus, the comparisons conducted in the study were between industries that were more and less covered before the 1972 EEOA.
Evidence produced by non-experimental studies is not as strong as that produced by an experimental design because subjects are not randomly assigned to treatment and comparison groups. In this study, individuals could have self-selected into employment at larger and smaller employers based on unobservable characteristics that are related to their labor market outcomes. Similarly, there might be self-selection of states in the passage of their fair employment practice laws and self-selection of establishments in their size, both of which could potentially reduce the comparability of the treatment and comparison groups.","",""

The quality of the causal evidence presented in this study is high because it is a well-executed randomized controlled trial. This means we have confidence that estimated effects would be attributable to JTPA programs, and not other factors.","","The JTPA, which was enacted in 1982, provided block grants to state and local governments to provide employment training to people facing difficulties obtaining employment. JTPA programs provided services such as remedial education and job-search assistance in local service-delivery areas. Typically, providers of such services included community colleges; community-based organizations; and vocational, technical, and proprietary schools. Program participants in JTPA who were involved in the study typically received three to four months of training, at an average cost of about $2,400 per participant.
JTPA replaced the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, which had similar job training goals. JTPA was itself replaced by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998.","The study examined the impacts of JTPA program participation on the long-term employment and earnings of male youth, female youth, adult men, and adult women; this review focuses on the analysis of male and female youth. To be eligible to participate, youth had to be ages 16 to 21 and not attending school at the time of application to JTPA.
The study drew on a subset of the sample used for the National JTPA Study (NJS), which randomly assigned more than 20,000 eligible out-of-school youth and adults in 16 local service delivery areas to treatment and control groups from November 1987 to September 1989. The current study examined long-term employment and earnings outcomes for that portion of the NJS sample for which five years of follow-up data were available in a Social Security Administration earnings records database (13,699 individuals; approximately 68 percent of the original sample). The analysis sample included about 1,700 male and 2,300 female youth.","The study reported no statistically significant differences between the earnings or employment rates of youth who had access to JTPA programs and those who did not in any of the five years after random assignment.","The authors noted that about one-third of those assigned to the treatment group did not actually enroll in JTPA. In addition, a substantial minority of the control group received some JTPA-like services from other resources available in the community. Because all youth were included in the analysis in their originally assigned groups, this reduces the difference between the services received by the treatment group and those received by the control group, which could understate the programs’ impacts.
In addition, the authors used t-tests, not regression models, to determine the statistical significance of differences between treatment and control group outcomes. Although this is an acceptable method of testing differences in a well-executed randomized controlled trial, the precision of these tests could have been enhanced by estimating regression models that included controls for baseline earnings.","",""

The study compared the blood lead levels of iron workers in 1993 and 1994, before and after the introduction of OSHA’s Lead Exposure in Construction Standard.
The study found that there was no significant difference in the maximum blood lead levels of iron workers from 1993 to 1994, but there was a decline in the increment in blood lead levels, defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum levels.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is low. This means we are not confident that any differences in blood lead levels of iron workers before and after the introduction of the OSHA Lead Exposure in Construction Standard were attributable solely to the introduction of the standard.","","The study examined the effect of OSHA’s Lead Exposure in Construction Standard, which was introduced in May 1993, on the blood lead levels of iron workers employed in the renovation of a large, lead-painted, steel bridge in New York City in 1993 and 1994. Most of the bridge contractor’s efforts to comply with the standard were in place by December 1993. The study examined workers’ baseline and maximum blood lead levels, and the maximum increment in blood lead levels, defined for each year as the difference between each individual’s minimum blood lead level and the maximum blood lead level that postdated the minimum.","The study compared the blood lead levels of iron workers in 1993 and 1994, before and after the introduction of OSHA’s Lead Exposure in Construction Standard.

The authors collected baseline and follow-up data on blood lead levels, demographics, and job tasks for 191 iron workers from February 1993 to December 1994. Baseline data for new employees were collected before, or as soon as possible after, they began work at the site. Blood lead testing was conducted either biweekly or monthly, depending on the study period and workers’ previous blood lead levels.","There was no significant difference in the maximum blood lead levels of iron workers from 1993 to 1994.
Iron workers newly hired onto the project in 1994 had significantly lower baseline blood lead levels than those hired in 1993.
The maximum increments in blood lead levels were significantly lower in 1994 than in 1993 for the entire sample of ironworkers and those present in both years, but not for the new hires.","In this study, the estimated differences in the blood lead levels of iron workers from 1993 to 1994 levels could reflect other changes in lead exposures over time, rather than the impact of the OSHA Lead Exposure in Construction Standard. For example, exposure to lead paint in houses and lead in drinking water or air could have changed over time and cannot be disentangled from changes in occupational lead exposure.","",""

About 6,000 out-of-school youth across 16 service delivery areas (SDAs) in the United States were randomly assigned to the treatment group (which was offered JTPA Title II-A services) or the control group (which could not participate in JTPA Title II services for 18 months). Although not the focus of this review, the study also randomly assigned more than 14,000 adults to treatment and control groups. Random assignment occurred from 1987 to 1989. The study team administered surveys to treatment and control group members 18 and 30 months after random assignment to collect information on earnings and educational attainment.
The study found that, for female youth, JTPA had a statistically significant, positive impact on attainment of a general educational development (GED) or high school diploma after 30 months; however, this did not hold for male youth. In addition, JTPA did not have a statistically significant impact on earnings for either female or male youth who had never been arrested.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this study is high for the employment outcomes for female and male youth who had not been arrested. This means we are confident that estimated impacts are solely attributable to JTPA, and not other factors. The education outcomes for all groups, and the employment outcomes for male youth who had been arrested, have moderate evidence. This means we have some confidence that the estimated effects would be attributable to JTPA, but other factors might also have contributed.","","The JTPA of 1982 Title II-A programs provided employment and training services to individuals through 649 SDAs in the United States. Services were provided on site or through other local providers. The Workforce Investment Act superseded the JTPA in 1998.
Although each site could maintain its own eligibility criteria, all applicants were required to have barriers to their ability to work. Many applicants were unemployed. Program staff screened applicants and recommended one of three types of services: (1) classroom training in occupational skills; (2) a blend of on-the-job training and/or job-search assistance; and (3) other services (including basic education services, such as high school or GED preparation and English as a second language courses, and pre-employment services, such as job-readiness training, vocational exploration, and job shadowing).","The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted in 16 SDAs in the United States. To estimate the effectiveness of JTPA, the authors randomly assigned about 6,000 youth to the intervention group, which received an offer to participate in JTPA, or to the control group, which was not permitted to participate in JTPA until 18 months later (the control group). Random assignment began in November 1987 and lasted until September 1989. The study compared the labor market earnings, educational and training participation and attainment, and welfare receipt of treatment and control group members to estimate impacts; it examined impacts separately by gender for adults and for youths ages 14 through 21 (this review discusses results for youth only).
The authors used data from surveys conducted 18 and 30 months after random assignment, supplemented with state Unemployment Insurance (UI) wage records in 12 SDAs. Earnings reported in surveys were used for participants who had full earnings information for the entire 30-month period. State UI wage records were used for participants with fewer than 30 months of survey data (through nonresponse or noninclusion in the 18-month survey).","A larger percentage of female youth in the treatment group earned a GED or high school diploma within 30 months than did those in the control group; the 7.7 percentage point difference was statistically significant.
JTPA was not associated with a statistically significant difference in attaining a GED or high school diploma within 30 months for male youth.
For females and male out-of-school youth who had not been arrested, JTPA did not have a statistically significant impact on earnings 30 months after randomization.
Male youth who had been arrested before enrollment in JTPA in the treatment group experienced statistically significant negative earnings impacts as measured by the 30-month survey; they earned $4,209 less than those in the control group. However, using state UI wage records, earnings did not differ significantly between the two groups. Because of the discrepancy in results from the two data sources, the authors could not make any strong conclusions about the impact of JTPA on earnings for male youth who had been previously arrested.","Many of the subgroups and outcomes examined in this report were based on a randomized controlled trial with low attrition, and so the study design for most findings received a high causal evidence rating. However, attrition was above acceptable thresholds for all outcomes examined for the subgroup of male youth who had been previously arrested, as well as for all educational outcomes examined. However, the authors included an extensive set of control variables in these analyses; therefore, the study design for this subgroup received a moderate causal evidence rating.
Not all youth who received an offer to participate in JTPA programs actually participated in them. This could temper the results, which were based on the offer to enroll, and not actually enrolling. Overall, about two-thirds of those eligible to enroll in JTPA did.","Fort Wayne, Indiana

The JTPA program offered academic and occupational training, on-the-job training, job search assistance, and other support services to adults and out-of-school youth.
This report used the experimental data from the National JTPA Study to explore whether JTPA had positive effects on earnings of subgroups of youth, factors that had positive impacts on welfare recipients’ earnings, and implications of the National JTPA Study for improving the JTPA performance management system.
The report found that the JTPA program had a small impact on the earnings of out-of-school youth and positive impacts on the earnings of female welfare recipients. The impact was greater for females older than 25 years than for females ages 16 to 24. JTPA services adapted toward immediate employment were more effective than other services for welfare recipients, and access to JTPA increased earnings of welfare recipients without decreasing welfare receipts because earnings increased only after they left welfare.
The authors concluded that the correlation between measured impact and performance indicators was usually positive, but statistically weak, and that this suggested the performance management system did not work as intended.","","","","","","",""

The study, which was part of an evaluation that also included impact and cost analyses, assessed the feasibility of providing VR services to SSA beneficiaries with severe disabilities. It drew on interviews with program staff, management information system data, and a variety of program documents to examine the roll-out and implementation of four models of service delivery, each implemented at two sites.
The authors determined that it was feasible to recruit people with severe disabilities for a rehabilitation program and provide the range of required services. Models with varying institutional arrangements were equally successful in attracting the interest of this population and arranging for the services they needed to meet their vocational goals.","","The SSA launched Project NetWork in 1991 to gauge the viability of providing the range of needed vocational rehabilitation services to its beneficiaries with acute disabilities. Specifically, it tested four models for recruitment and service provision that varied in intensity and by hosting institution. The four models, each implemented in two sites over a 24-month period, included the following:
The SSA Case Manager Model, in which existing SSA staff without a VR background conducted case management (with support from field consultants with VR experience)
The SSA Referral Manager Model, in which existing SSA staff without prior VR experience were again asked to take the lead, but only in referring beneficiaries to external providers of case management services (preferably those who could offer no-cost or subsidized services)
The Private Contractor Model, in which private sector providers with VR expertise conducted case management
The VR Outstationing Model, in which staff from state VR agencies were out-stationed to local SSA offices to act as case managers
The eight study sites were located mostly in urban areas in eight states.","This study examined the implementation of Project NetWork’s four models of service delivery. Specifically, it assessed the efficacy of the variety of outreach strategies used; whether it was possible to provide all the services to a beneficiary pool with widely varying disabilities and goals needed; and how progress on outreach and service provision varied across the four strategies. It also highlighted implementation successes and challenges throughout different phases of the program. To gather these data, the evaluators interviewed program staff at all eight sites at four points during the program period—conducting about 200 in-person interviews with case managers, referral managers, project leads, and relevant administrative staff. In addition, the evaluators drew on program data and documents, which included procedures manuals, forms used by staff to guide program processes, notes from calls between headquarters and local staff, and 160 beneficiary case folders (20 from each site).","Overall, the study found that all the models achieved similar results in terms of meeting recruitment and intake goals and serving a variety of beneficiaries. As intended, the SSA Referral Manager Model provided services at lower intensity. It relied largely on existing assessment information, developed individual referral plans rather than the more comprehensive individual employment plans, and purchased fewer services.
The study also highlighted a number of successes and challenges with various aspects of the program:
Recruitment. The demonstration met its recruitment targets—5 percent of all eligible beneficiaries volunteered to participate in Project NetWork. Of the variety of recruitment strategies used, quarterly invitation letters to SSA beneficiaries were most successful, bringing in the majority (60 percent) of all volunteers, who numbered 8,248 in total. However, considerable backlogs developed in response to these mailings, which resulted in delays in starting screening procedures and service provision. The authors suggested sending smaller batches of invitation letters more frequently to prevent such backlogs. 
Intake. After beneficiaries expressed interest in the program, they were invited to take part in an informational interview and randomly assigned to the treatment or control group. During intensive periods of beneficiary intake, those already enrolled in the program did not always receive the attention and support they needed from program staff. Study participants suggested different staff members perform the beneficiary intake and service provision functions in the future to ensure that program participants received the support they required at all times.
Conducting initial assessments. Managers gathered medical, psychological, and vocational assessment information on the beneficiaries to gain a comprehensive understanding of their goals, needs, and work-related limitations. Most medical and psychological assessments were obtained from the beneficiaries’ existing providers at no cost, which enabled managers to reduce spending, but resulted in delays that had a detrimental effect on beneficiaries’ interest in the project. There were also delays in obtaining vocational assessments, which some managers addressed by conducting the assessments themselves.
Preparing plans. Staff in three of the four models developed individual employment plans, which specified the beneficiaries’ work-related goals and intermediate objectives, services to be provided to the beneficiary, and core activities to be completed by the case manager and beneficiary. The SSA Referral Manager Model sites prepared individual referral plans, which only described goals and listed referrals to external providers, and took less time to develop than the more comprehensive employment plans. Program managers across all the sites expressed the need for more training on preparing these plans.
Service delivery. After completing a plan, program managers brokered a variety of rehabilitation services for beneficiaries, of which job placement support was most common (it was provided to 30 percent of all beneficiaries). Other services included training, transportation support, specialized services, and medical and psychological services. Beneficiaries were also provided assistive devices, financial support to cover employment-related costs (such as uniforms and tools), and assistance with emergency costs. In the SSA Case Manager and SSA Referral Manager models, managers found the compilation of lists of service providers particularly challenging given their lack of experience in the field.","This was a focused study that set out well-defined research questions and structured its analysis to provide targeted information on the feasibility of the program. Quantitative management information system data supported the findings, providing an overview of levels of participation and beneficiaries’ progress through various program stages, and qualitative interview data collected at strategic junctures throughout the program, which offered insight into the feasibility of key activities, from program launch to intake to service provision. The article did not provide enough information on data collection and analysis to be able to assess the reliability and objectivity of the data and the methods used to elicit findings. However, there were no indications of bias in the article—the authors were neutral in describing key findings and highlighted both successes and challenges in implementation","",""

The analysis is based on a 1996 survey of students who were high school sophomores in 1990 to 1993.
Career Academy graduates reported higher graduation rates (8.7 percentage points) and higher rates of enrollment in a two- or four-year college (11.6 and 17.9 percentage points, respectively) than students in the general education track.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is low because the authors did not adequately control for the academic achievement of students before they enrolled in a Career Academy. This means we are not confident that the results estimated in the study are attributable to Career Academies; other factors are likely responsible.","","Career Academies aim to make the high school experience more academically rigorous and relevant to subsequent careers. They achieve this by creating small learning communities; integrating academic and vocational curricula (typically focused around one occupation, profession, or industry); and offering work-based learning experiences, often through partnerships with local employers and post-secondary institutions. Career Academies work with the employers to ensure that the curriculum reflects their needs, and employers often provide summer work experience and mentoring to career academy students.
This study examined Career Academies in one large, West Coast, urban school district. The district first opened a Career Academy in 1985 and had 12 at the time of the study. The Career Academies varied in their career focus and were at different stages of implementation. Students self-selected into attending a Career Academy or continuing in an academic, vocational, or general track. The direct costs of the Career Academy were $1,000 more per student than the standard high school offering.","The study examined measures of educational achievement, such as on-time high school graduation and two- or four-year college enrollment, as well as various educational and labor market skills. The authors estimated the effects of high school program track—Career Academy, vocational education, or academic track—on these achievement and skills outcomes, controlling for students’ and schools’ characteristics. In addition, the authors attempted to control for students’ program track selection by estimating the effect of retrospective student-reported assessments of their own pre-program awareness and skills. This information was gathered through a post-graduation survey mailed to 10,102 students who attended school in the district as sophomores from 1990 to 1993. The authors also collected district records for these students. Students returned 1,223 surveys. The authors reported estimates for the full sample and for subgroups based on gender, ethnicity, and English language ability.","Career Academy graduates reported higher graduation rates (8.7 percentage points) and higher rates of enrollment in a two- or four-year college (11.6 and 17.9 percentage points, respectively) than students in the general education track.","The study authors attempted to control for students’ program selection by adjusting their results to account for known correlates between observable student characteristics and program selection. They also attempted to compensate for low survey response rates by corroborating their findings with a nationally representative National Educational Longitudinal Study sample. However, although the authors intended to control for standardized achievement test scores, these data were unavailable for almost half the study sample.
Without additional controls for the baseline nonequivalence of students from each of the three program tracks, and evidence of the representativeness of the survey respondent sample to the fielded sample, it is likely that the estimates of program effects are confounded by the initial student program selection and subsequent survey response bias.","",""

Treatment group D participants were required to make two contacts per week (like the control group) and were informed that their contacts would be verified.","","Treatment group A, which required two additional employer contacts per week, reduced the amount and duration of UI benefits received by $116 and 0.7 weeks, on average. These differences were statistically significant.
Treatment group B, which maintained the requirement of two employer contacts per week but did not require documentation of them, did not have an effect on UI benefit receipt outcomes.
Treatment group C, which required claimants to participate in a job search workshop, reduced the amount and duration of UI benefits received by $75 and 0.6 weeks, on average, per claimant.
Treatment group D, in which claimants were told that the two employer contacts would be verified each week, reduced the amount and duration of UI benefits received by $113 and 0.9 weeks, on average.
Although treatment groups A, C, and D reduced UI benefit amounts and durations, they had no impacts on employment or earnings of participants relative to the control group. Treatment group B had no effect on UI benefit receipt outcomes, but did increase earnings relative to the control group in the first year by almost $350.","Using hazard models, the authors estimated that the strictest interventions, mandatory job search workshop (treatment group C) and verified employer contacts (treatment group D), each increased the likelihood of exiting UI by 6 percent relative to the control group. The authors further noted that the impact of the mandatory workshop appeared to occur before the workshop itself, suggesting that the effort of attending the workshop deterred UI claimants from benefit receipt rather than helped them enhance their job search. The lack of differences in earnings between treatment groups that did exhibit impacts on UI benefit receipt and duration suggests that those claimants were not entering into lower-wage employment as a result of exiting UI earlier.","",""

In this demonstration, about 11,000 UI claimants were randomized into one of three treatment groups, all of which received some variation of Job Search Assistance (JSA) services, or into the control group, which could receive only existing services in the community. For all participants, the study team collected administrative data, which provided information on UI receipt, employment, and earnings.
The study found that the treatment group that received JSA services and a reemployment bonus had a statistically significant reduction in UI dollars received and UI weeks paid, compared with the control group. There were no significant impacts on the probability of working, level of earnings, or weeks worked in the long run for any of the treatment groups.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it is based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the interventions studied, and not to other factors.","Absence of conflict of interest: This study was conducted by staff from Mathematica Policy Research, which administers CLEAR. Therefore, the review of this study was conducted by an independent consultant trained in applying the CLEAR causal evidence guidelines.","Implemented in 10 randomly selected UI offices across New Jersey, the demonstration mandated participation in JSA services for displaced workers who were recently unemployed to foster their quick reemployment. The demonstration had three service offerings: (1) JSA only, (2) JSA plus training or relocation services, and (3) JSA plus a reemployment bonus. All three interventions shared the same JSA components: an orientation session and testing; five half-day job-search workshop sessions at local New Jersey UI offices; a one-on-one counseling and assessment session with office staff; and a requirement to maintain contact with the demonstration office, either by discussing job-search activities with office staff or using the office’s resource center to conduct job-search activities.
The JSA-only group received no services other than JSA services. In the JSA-plus-training group, staff informed participants about training and relocation services available and helped participants plan their training options. In the JSA-plus-reemployment-bonus group, participants who became reemployed quickly received a bonus equal to one-half of their remaining UI entitlement at the time of the assessment if they found employment within two weeks. The bonus declined in value by 10 percent of the original amount per week. Participants received 60 percent of the bonus if they held the job for four weeks; they received all of it if they were employed for 12 weeks. Bonuses were not available to claimants who were rehired by their former employers; were employed by a relative; or were in temporary, seasonal, or part-time work.
Eligibility screening for the demonstration excluded claimants who (1) had not received their first UI payment, had their first payment more than five weeks after their initial claim, had a partial first payment, or a special type of claim (such as a claim by an ex-service member); (2) were younger than 25 years old; (3) had been on their previous job for fewer than three years; (4) had a specific date for being recalled by their former employers; and (5) were typically hired through union hiring halls.","All those eligible for the demonstration were randomly assigned to the JSA-only group (2,416 participants), JSA-plus-training group (3,810 participants), JSA plus-reemployment-bonus group (2,449 participants), or the control group (2,385 participants). Administrative UI data were collected from initial intake into the study (from July 1986 to June 1987) through mid-October 1993. Data on employment and earnings came from quarterly wage records through the second quarter of 1993.
To measure impacts on UI receipt, employment, and earnings, the authors compared the outcomes of members of each of the three treatment groups with those of the control group.","By the sixth year of follow-up, only the JSA-plus-reemployment-bonus group had statistically significant differences from the control group. Over all six years, this group received $333 less in UI benefits and 1.7 fewer weeks of UI benefits paid than did the control group.
There were no statistically significant impacts on employment, earnings, or weeks worked for any of the treatment groups over the six-year follow-up period.","Only 15 percent of the JSA-plus-training group participated in training. In addition, the authors noted that not all sample members completed follow-up data. Finally, the labor market, UI program, and reemployment services have changed considerably since this study was conducted. Therefore, a similar study conducted in the current environment might find different results.","",""

TEI randomly assigned eligible Supplemental Security Income recipients to a treatment or control group at eight training agencies serving 13 communities in seven states. All eight agencies implemented the basic demonstration model successfully, although their methods of providing basic services differed, as did their results. Overall, average earnings were substantially higher for people who were enrolled in the demonstration. However, agency-specific estimates varied from large and statistically significant to small and not statistically significant.
By comparing the implementing agencies across multiple characteristics identified in the process study, this study found that the most successful programs tailored their services to the needs of each participant, developed jobs in a wide array of occupations, and kept people in the program for a longer period than the other agencies. The implementing agencies persisted in placing participants who lost a job into second, third, or fourth jobs.
The study also found cost implications of the successful strategies. Average costs for the three high-impact agencies were approximately $7,000 per enrolled participant, and approximately $6,000 per participant for the three low-impact agencies.","","","","","","",""

The full evaluation consisted of an estimation of participant impacts and cost-benefit analysis for four of eight study sites and estimation of community impacts for all eight sites. Data sources for the participant-level impact analysis included a self-administered baseline survey and enrollment form and a follow-up telephone survey conducted 15 months after random assignment.
The study found statistically significant, positive impacts for program participants on the likelihood of having worked for pay since program enrollment and working a larger number of total hours since program enrollment (including time spent in the corps).
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this study is moderate. This means we have some confidence that the estimated effects are attributable to the Conservation and Youth Service Corps programs, but other factors might also have contributed.","","Conservation and Youth Service Corps programs, funded under Subtitle C of the National and Community Service Act of 1990, established and expanded full-time and summer programs for out-of-school youth ages 18 to 25. The programs were designed to be labor-intensive; instill public service and a good work ethic in participants; involve youth working in teams; and increase skill development, educational attainment, and employment opportunities for participants. The programs revolved around conducting community service activities for the betterment of the community as a whole. Over the 14-month period examined in this report, participants engaged in an average of 435 hours of service, primarily for community-based or not-for-profit organizations. Specific activities included tutoring students, organizing community events, rehabilitating housing for low-income residents, and storm clean-up.","This study examined 8 of the 100 year-round Conservation and Youth Service Corps programs that received funding in the 1993–1994 program year. The impact evaluation component of the study focused on 4 study sites that had large, mature programs. In these sites, the study randomly assigned applicants to either a treatment group that received the program or a control group that was prohibited from enrolling in the program for one year.
The impact evaluation drew on data from a self-administered baseline survey and enrollment form and a follow-up telephone survey conducted 15 months after random assignment with both treatment and control group members. The analysis sample for the study included 626 participants, of which 383 were in the treatment group and 243 in the control group.","The study reported a greater likelihood for program participants to have worked for pay since program enrollment compared with the control group (89 versus 73 percent); this difference was statistically significant.
The study also reported that program group participants worked 40 percent more hours than control group members (2,030 versus 1,464 hours); this difference was statistically significant. The study noted that these positive impacts were largely attributable to work done while in the corps.
The study did not find statistically significant positive impacts on average monthly earnings or being employed at the time of the follow-up survey.
Subgroup analyses by race and gender found generally positive impacts on employment outcomes for African Americans and Hispanics, with especially positive results for African American males.","Although this research is based on a randomized controlled trial, the number of youth who were initially randomly assigned to the treatment and control groups was not provided in the report. Attempts to retrieve this information from study authors were unsuccessful due to the age of the study. In the absence of this information, the research cannot receive a high causal evidence rating.

The study was part of a larger randomized control trial (see CLEAR’s profile of Kemple & Willner [2008] for final evaluation results).
The study drew on data from a baseline student questionnaire, site visits, information gathering during site selection and monitoring for the broader evaluation, a teacher survey, and school administrative data on study participants.
The study focused on implementation of the Career Academies model in the sites that were purposively selected to participate in the broader evaluation. The authors noted that all 10 study sites adopted and maintained the key elements of the Career Academy approach in a variety of contexts. Study sites attracted high application rates from students with diverse demographic and educational characteristics, and the program was attractive to both at-risk students and students performing well in school. Most (84 percent) students accepted in the Academies enrolled and three-quarters of enrollees were still engaged with the program two years later. Compared with non-Academy teachers, Career Academy teachers were more likely to report having opportunities to partner with their colleagues, to view their workplace as a learning community, and to develop individualized relationships with students.
The study’s insights on fidelity to the program model and the ability of the program to be adapted to diverse contexts and types of students should be extrapolated with caution because these were the very criteria used to select sites for participation in the evaluation.","","Career Academies were first established some 45 years ago and have become a widely used high school reform initiative. They are designed to keep students engaged in school and improve their employment and educational outcomes. Students apply for admission into Career Academies during 8th or 9th grades (depending on the rules of the program to which they are applying).
Career Academies have three distinguishing features, and the study authors pointed out that a true Career Academy must exhibit all three:
They are organized as small learning communities, or schools within schools. They typically serve 150 to 200 students from grades 9 or 10 through grade 12. This smaller size fosters a more personalized learning environment.
The curriculum is organized around one career, occupation, or industry and combines academic and technical aspects relevant to the career.
The academies offer work-based learning experiences, often through partnerships with local employers. These can include summer employment, internships, and mentoring.","The study examined the implementation of Career Academies in 10 sites that were purposively selected to be part of a randomized controlled trial. The study selected sites that (1) were mature and incorporated the three key elements of the Career Academy model; (2) operated in diverse contexts reflecting the range of circumstances in which Career Academies have been established; (3) served students at risk of failure, in addition to high-performing ones; (4) had a clear contrast with the regular school offerings and other programs available within the high school; and (5) were willing to abide by the requirements of the randomized evaluation. The selected sites were located in nine school districts in six states; most were in large school districts with high proportions of low-income and minority students. These districts had higher-than-average dropout and unemployment rates.
The study examined the degree to which sites adhered to the Career Academy model in the early stages of the evaluation; described the study’s recruitment of the sites, the student recruitment and selection process, and the baseline characteristics of the study sample, on aggregate and by site; and compared the characteristics and experiences of teachers in Career Academies with those of non-Academy teachers. The study drew on data from (1) a baseline questionnaire administered to program applicants in the study sites; (2) site visits that included interviews with teachers, students, district and school administrators, and employers, as well as observations of classes, student recruitment, and other program activities; (3) information gathered during the site selection process and during monitoring visits to study sites; (4) a teacher survey; and (5) school administrative data on study participants.","All study sites adopted and maintained the key structural elements required for being a Career Academy: a school-within-a-school format, a curriculum integrating academic and occupational courses directed toward a career theme, and partnerships with local employers. Factors that affected implementation of Career Academies included availability of resources, the Academy directors’ leadership ability, support from the school and school district, allocation of staff time to collaborate with one another and organize employers’ engagement and work placements, the extent of employers’ participation, and the articulation of a vision that connected program design with local employment needs.
Study sites attracted high application rates, thanks in part to new outreach and recruitment initiatives included as part of the study, from students with diverse demographic and educational characteristics. The program was attractive to both at-risk students and students performing well in school. Most (84 percent) of the students who were accepted into the Career Academies enrolled in them, and 75 percent were participating two years later. These participation rates were high given the high transfer rates among similar students who were not in the Academy. Academy teachers reported student attendance rates that were 3 percent higher than those reported by non-Academy teachers.
Compared with non-Academy teachers, Career Academy teachers were more likely to report having opportunities to partner with their colleagues, view their workplace as a learning community, and develop individualized relationships with students. They also appeared to receive greater resources: they reported lower course loads, providing time to work on curriculum development and student interactions. They also tended to have fewer students per class (on average 3 students fewer per class and 22 fewer students across all classes). Academy and non-Academy teachers worked similar hours outside of school on school-related work (14 to 15 hours per week).","The study effectively used descriptive statistics to provide insights on the baseline characteristics of students and teachers and the experiences of teachers. The study did not include a thorough description of qualitative data collection, data analysis, data quality control, and triangulation methods. Although vignettes of study sites offered a good illustration of key findings, the lack of information on the prevalence of the findings across study sites makes it difficult to determine the extent to which the findings based on site visits and interviews reflect the typical program experience. The study’s insights on fidelity to the program model and the ability of the program to be adapted to diverse contexts and types of students should be extrapolated with caution because these were the very criteria used to select sites for participation in the evaluation.","Academy for Aerospace Technology, Cocoa, Florida

The authors analyzed the effect of federal contractor status on racial and ethnic groups’ shares of a firm’s employment while also accounting for other establishment-level differences using data from the 1979–1992 Employer Information Report EEO-1 files.
The study found that by 1992, the African American employment share was 1.36 percentage points higher among federal contractors than at an average EEO-1 reporting company. For Hispanics, however, federal contractor status had the opposite effect; it decreased the proportion of Hispanic employees by 0.45 percentage points in 1992.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is low. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to Executive Order 11246; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Affirmative action Executive Order 11246, signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965, reinforced prohibitions in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and earlier executive orders against discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin; subsequent Orders and revisions have added sex (1967) and sexual orientation and gender identity (2014) as protected classes. Order 11246 required the federal government and federal contractors with 50 or more employees or $50,000 in contracts to develop written affirmative action plans and ensure equal opportunities for all workers. The Order authorized the Secretary of Labor to establish the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs to enforce federal contractors’ compliance.","The authors investigated the effect of federal antidiscrimination policies by examining the relationship between minority (African American, Asian, and Hispanic) employment share and federal contractor status, which subjects organizations to antidiscrimination laws that do not apply to all employers. Using Employer Information Report EEO-1 files from 1979 through 1992, the authors estimated a model to explain an establishment’s minority employment share as a function of federal contractor status, controlling for its location; city status; whether the business had one or multiple establishments,whether the establishment was a headquarters, major industry classification, segregation index, and occupational structure. EEO-1 files are establishment-level data from annual workforce surveys that employers meeting certain size requirements must submit to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. Before 1982, private employers with at least 50 employees and federal contractors with at least 25 employees were required to file EEO-1 reports; since then, the size requirements have risen to 100 or 50 employees, respectively.","In 1982, the African American employment share was significantly higher among federal contractors than at an average EEO-1 company by 0.83 percentage points. By 1992, the African American employment share was significantly higher at federal contractors than at an average EEO-1 company by 1.36 percentage points.
The Hispanic employment share was significantly lower among federal contractors than on average in 1982 by 0.17 percentage points. This significant disparity increased to 0.45 percentage points in 1992.
By contrast, the Asian employment share was significantly higher among federal contractors in 1982, by 0.20 percentage points.","Although the authors controlled for several employment establishment characteristics, such as location and industry, they did not control for highly relevant characteristics, such as size and revenue, which were likely to affect the outcomes of interest. Federal contractors in the sample were systematically smaller in terms of number of employees than other firms, because they had smaller size requirements for filing EEO-1 forms, a confound that could lead us to attribute effects of establishment size to federal contractor status. Moreover, the establishments that self-selected to be federal contractors were most likely to be those that found it least burdensome to adhere to affirmative action regulations, reducing the comparability of the treatment and comparison groups. For these reasons, the estimated effects of federal contractor status might be due in part to other factors.
In addition, the authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to employment, estimating separate regressions for each minority group for each of several years. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","",""

Randomized controlled trials were conducted separately in both Pennsylvania and Washington State and included a total of about 27,500 UI claimants. The authors estimated impacts of the reemployment bonus programs on UI benefits receipt and earnings using state UI administrative records.
The study found that, on average, UI claimants who had been randomly assigned to receive any of the reemployment bonus offers received 0.5 fewer weeks and $85 less in total UI benefits than those assigned to the control group. However, they were no more or less likely to exhaust UI benefits or have higher earnings in the year following random assignment than control group members.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it is based on pooled analysis of two well-implemented randomized controlled trials.

Therefore, the review of this study was conducted by an independent consultant trained in applying the CLEAR causal evidence guidelines.","Pennsylvania
Implemented in 12 randomly selected offices across Pennsylvania, the demonstration restricted eligibility to UI claimants who had filed within the past two weeks, did not have a definite recall date to their former employers, and did not routinely obtain employment through a union hiring hall. The demonstration had six different bonus offerings. The first four entailed different combinations of reemployment bonus amounts—either three or six times the UI weekly benefit amount—and periods within which participants were required to find a job in order to claim the bonus, known as a qualification period. The qualification period was either 6 weeks or 12 weeks. In addition, to claim any bonus, claimants needed to maintain employment for four months. The fifth bonus offering started at a high amount during the 12-week qualification period but declined over time, and the sixth bonus offering was identical to the fourth, except that it excluded the offer of a job search workshop, which was available to all the other bonus groups.
Washington
In Washington, 21 of the job service centers operating at the time implemented the experiment. Six different bonus offerings were available to eligible UI claimants. These resulted from different combinations of reemployment bonus amounts—either two, four, or six times the UI weekly benefit amount—and periods within which participants were required to find a job in order to claim the bonus, known as a qualification period. The qualification period was either 7 or 13 weeks. To claim the bonus, participants needed to secure a job within the qualification period and maintain it for four months. In contrast to Pennsylvania, Washington did not deny eligibility to claimants with an expected recall date to their previous employers or to those who routinely obtained employment through a union hiring hall.","In Pennsylvania, about 15,000 eligible UI claimants from 1988 and 1989 were randomly assigned to either receive the offer of one of the six reemployment bonuses or to an existing services control group, which was not offered a reemployment bonus and continued to receive weekly UI benefits payments subject to existing requirements. This study did not examine the fifth bonus type included in the original study because it was structured very differently from any of the other bonuses in Pennsylvania or Washington. The total analysis sample size from the Pennsylvania demonstration was about 12,000.
In Washington, more than 15,500 new UI claimants were randomly assigned into one of the six reemployment bonus groups or a control group from February to November 1988. Participants randomly assigned to the control group received the same weekly UI benefits payments over the same maximum weeks of eligibility, but were not offered a reemployment bonus.
This study pooled the data from the Pennsylvania and Washington experiments, using the enhanced statistical power of the much larger combined sample to determine the effectiveness of the reemployment bonus offer with greater certainty and precision. The authors estimated the average differences between a combined treatment group consisting of UI claimants randomly assigned to any of the treatment groups and control group members on UI benefits receipt and earnings drawn from UI administrative data.","The study found that UI claimants offered a reemployment bonus received 0.5 fewer weeks and $85 less in total UI benefits during their benefit years than those assigned to the existing services control group; these differences were statistically significant. However, claimants were neither more nor less likely to exhaust UI benefits.
The reemployment bonuses had no statistically significant impacts on average quarterly earnings in the quarter in which claimants applied for benefits or three quarters thereafter.","The labor market and UI program have changed considerably since the demonstrations examined in this study were conducted. Therefore, a similar study conducted in the current environment might find different results.","",""

Therefore, the review of this study was conducted by an independent consultant trained in applying the CLEAR causal evidence guidelines.","The TETD operated from 1985 to 1987 and was designed to help SSI recipients with intellectual disabilities enter or reenter the workforce and hold competitive jobs. The service providers in each of the 13 U.S. metropolitan communities served by the eight competitively procured service providers offered five transitional employment services: (1) outreach to recruit study participants; (2) benefit protection waivers that ensured participants maintained SSI eligibility while receiving training; (3) placement in potentially permanent, competitive jobs; (4) on-the-job employability training and employment case management; and (5) post-employment placement case management and reemployment placements. Demonstration services lasted for up to 12 months.
Eligibility for TETD was limited to SSI recipients ages 18 to 40 with a diagnosis of intellectual disability who lived in a community in the study. Of the 745 volunteer SSI recipients who were in the study, 375 were randomally assigned into the TETD treatment and 370 into the control group, which could not receive the employment services. The participants in TETD were a particularly disadvantaged subset of all SSI recipients, with relatively low pre-enrollment earnings ($450 per year), pre-enrollment employment in a regular competitive job (10 percent), and intelligence quotient (IQ) (median 57).","Data for the study were collected from administrative records, including the SSR, which records benefit payments, earnings, and SSI recipient income information, and intake data collection forms that gathered participants’ information on demographics, living arrangements, previous work history, types of disabilities, and the intake worker’s assement of a participant’s probability of obtaining and maintaining employent.
The authors estimated average impacts on employment, earnings, total income, amount of SSI benefits received, and probability of receiving SSDI benefits for the six years following enrollment by comparing these outcomes for treatment and control group members.","The study found positive, statistically significant impacts in favor of the treatment group on employment-related outcomes for the duration of the six-year follow-up period. Treatment group members were 9 to 15 percentage points more likely to be employed than control group members, depending on the year examined.

These reforms typically tried to improve the employment prospects of beneficiaries and reduce UI costs.
The author reviewed 10 randomized controlled trials of UI reforms—4 cash bonus experiments and 6 job-search experiments—and provided a comparative analysis on how these reforms affected average weeks of UI benefits paid, UI program costs, and recipients’ earnings, when available. The cash bonus experiments offered a cash payment to participants who quickly found and kept a job for an indicated length of time, although the details varied greatly across experiments. Job-search assistance reforms also varied but typically involved changes in the way job-search programs were implemented in terms of services offered and reporting and participation requirements.
The review found that some cash bonus reforms reduced the average number of weeks participants spent on UI by a statistically significant margin, compared with the control group. The review also found that some job-search assistance reforms reduced participants’ average number of weeks on UI and increased average quarterly earnings compared with the control group; however, not all findings for all reforms were statistically significant.","","","","","","",""

The authors conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Researchers administered a pre-test two weeks before the intervention and two post-tests one and four months after the intervention, comparing the outcomes of Jobs Program participants against those of a control group.
The study found statistically significant associations between being offered access to the Jobs Program and increased earnings one and four months later.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the study was an RCT with post-intervention subsampling based on participation in the intervention. In addition, the authors did not include sufficient controls in their analysis. This means we are not confident that any estimated effects would be attributable to the Jobs Program; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","The Jobs Program consisted of eight three-hour training sessions conducted on four mornings of each of two weeks. Sessions were led by male-female pairs of trainers, who had received about 80 hours of formal training and were regularly observed by members of the research team. Sessions focused on (1) establishing trust in the trainers, (2) building self-esteem and motivation, and (3) teaching specific job search skills. Skills targeted included identifying and effectively expressing competencies, using social connections to find job leads, contacting potential employers, preparing applications, and interviewing.
In addition to teaching job search skills, the intervention focused on the mental and emotional well-being of participants. Session time was dedicated to “psychologically inoculating” participants against losing their motivation in the face of prolonged unemployment by teaching problem-solving skills designed to help participants anticipate setbacks and adapt when they arose. Trainers also offered direct encouragement and support during the intervention and provided opportunities for other participants to support one another.","The authors conducted an RCT, randomly assigning 1,122 people to either treatment or control groups. Those in the treatment group were given the opportunity to attend the Jobs Program, whereas those in the control group were provided with self-instructional materials on general job search strategies. Study participants were recruited from four unemployment compensation offices across southern Michigan. The recruitment process limited the study to people who were applying for or receiving unemployment compensation in the state. Individuals were considered ineligible to participate if they were within two years of retirement, expected to be recalled to their previous job, were judged by experimenters as showing clear indications of mental illness, or reported being unemployed for more than four months. Researchers administered a pre-test two weeks before the intervention began and two post-tests one and four months after the intervention ended. Impacts were estimated by comparing unadjusted treatment and control group means.","Compared with the control group, the treatment group reported significantly higher average monthly earnings one month after the intervention ($512 versus $322) and four months after the intervention ($853 versus $723).","Attrition is difficult to discern in this study because the authors did not provide sample sizes by treatment condition at each follow-up period and presented different sample sizes in different studies describing the same experiment. However, the fact that only a subset of participants who were assigned to the Jobs Program but dropped out were sampled for the follow-up surveys means that random assignment was compromised and the study cannot receive a high causal evidence rating. This is because the decision to participate in Jobs occurred after random assignment; to preserve the integrity of the random assignment process, the authors would have had to attempt to survey all of those randomly assigned to the Jobs program, including all those who did not ultimately participate in it.
Compromised RCTs can receive a moderate causal evidence rating if they include controls for demographic and pre-intervention variables specified in CLEAR’s topic area review protocol. Because the study did not include all the required controls in the analysis, it cannot receive a moderate causal evidence rating. In particular, the study did not include controls for employment stability, pre-intervention employment, or earnings measured more than one year before random assignment.
Lastly, it should be noted that 59 percent of the treatment group did not actually participate in treatment. However, the authors included these participants in their main analysis of the program. Thus, the impact estimates might understate the effect of the intervention on those who participated.","",""

Each state conducted separate randomized controlled trials. The authors calculated weekly UI exit rates using state UI administrative records.
The study found that both programs significantly increased the weekly rates at which bonus-eligible UI claimants left the UI rolls during the qualification period relative to claimants who were not bonus-eligible, by 14 percent in New Jersey and 18 percent in Illinois.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it is based on two well-implemented randomized controlled trials.

Therefore, the review of this study was conducted by an independent consultant trained in applying the CLEAR causal evidence guidelines.","New Jersey
Implemented in 10 randomly selected UI offices, the New Jersey demonstration mandated participation in JSA services for displaced workers who were recently unemployed to foster their quick reemployment. The demonstration had three service offerings: (1) JSA only; (2) JSA plus training or relocation services; and (3) JSA plus a reemployment bonus. All three interventions shared the same JSA components: an orientation session and testing; five half-day job-search workshop sessions at local New Jersey UI offices; a one-on-one counseling and assessment session with office staff; and a requirement to maintain contact with the demonstration office, either by discussing job-search activities with office staff or using the office’s resource center to conduct job-search activities. The JSA-only group received no services other than JSA services. In the JSA-plus-training group, staff informed participants about training and relocation services available and helped participants plan their training options. In the JSA-plus-reemployment-bonus group, participants who became reemployed quickly received a bonus equal to one-half of the person’s remaining UI entitlement at the time of the assessment if he or she found employment within 2 weeks, and declined in value by 10 percent of the original amount per week. Participants received 60 percent of the bonus if they held the job for 4 weeks; they received all of it if they were employed for 12 weeks. Bonuses were not available to claimants who were rehired by their former employers; were employed by a relative; or were in temporary, seasonal, or part-time work.
Illinois
Conducted in 22 job services offices in northern and central Illinois, the job incentive experiment served a wide range of UI claimants, offering a flat, $500 reemployment bonus (approximately four times the weekly benefit amount) to those who secured a job within 11 weeks of filing an initial claim and held it for four months. Illinois participants were notified of the bonus offer as soon as they registered for employment services (that is, within 2 weeks of their initial claim) and thus had 9 to 11 weeks to secure a job.","For the New Jersey analysis, the author compared two research groups from the New Jersey Unemployment Insurance Reemployment Demonstration Project—the 2,416 participants who were randomly assigned to the JSA-only group and the 2,449 participants who were randomly assigned to the JSA-plus-reemployment-bonus group. Thus, the author held constant the effects of the job search services and isolated the impact of the reemployment bonus on the weekly exit rate among bonus-eligible UI recipients.
For the Illinois analysis, the author included all participants of the Illinois Job Search Incentive Experiment—4,186 participants randomly assigned to the treatment group and eligible for the bonus and 3,852 participants randomly assigned to the control group and ineligible for a bonus.
This study focuses on when, and at what rate relative to their nonbonus-eligible counterparts, UI claimants in each group left UI. The study employed hazard models separately for each state to understand the influence of the reemployment bonus on the conditional exit rate. The model included variables to indicate whether the time period examined was before (for New Jersey only, because Illinois claimants qualified immediately after random assignment), during, or after the bonus qualification period.","The study found that, in New Jersey, weekly UI exit rates were 14 percent higher among JSA-plus-reemployment-bonus claimants than among JSA-only claimants during the qualification period, and this difference was statistically significant. There were no statistically significant differences in exit rates before or after the qualification period. 
In Illinois, weekly UI exit rates were 18 percent higher among bonus-eligible claimants than among control group claimants during the qualification period and no different afterward.","The labor market, UI program, and reemployment services have changed considerably since this study was conducted. Therefore, a similar study conducted in the current environment might find different results.","",""

Both programs sought to determine how feasible self-employment was as a reemployment option for Unemployment Insurance (UI) recipients. This profile focused only on the program design and outcomes of the Enterprise Project.
The Enterprise Project was evaluated using a randomized controlled trial in which program applicants were randomly assigned to either a treatment group, which could receive Enterprise Project services, or a control group, which received UI benefits as usual. Outcomes of interest included measures of employment, self-employment, earnings, and UI benefit receipt.
The study found that applicants in the treatment group entered self-employment and wage employment at higher rates than those in the control group. They also had higher earnings, on average, and reduced UI benefit duration and amount received.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this study is high. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Enterprise Project, and not to other factors.","","Authorized by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, Massachusetts’ Enterprise Project was a federally sponsored self-employment demonstration program for unemployed workers. The goal was to determine whether self-employment was a viable reemployment strategy for UI claimants. The Enterprise Project was conducted in seven sites statewide and focused on UI claimants who were likely to exhaust their UI benefits. This study included 521 claimants, 263 of whom were randomized to the treatment group and 258 to the control group.
Treatment group members were required to attend counseling sessions with a personal business counselor and a series of six two-hour Enterprise workshops. The program provided biweekly payments equal to claimants’ regular UI benefits and exempted them from the UI work search requirement. The control group received regular UI benefits and services.
To estimate the Enterprise Project’s impacts, the researchers used data from a follow-up telephone survey administered to all study participants about 19 months after random assignment. The survey captured data on employment and earnings, unemployment, time spent looking for work, and Enterprise Project experiences. The authors also used administrative data collected from several state agencies on program enrollment and activity, UI wages, and business activity. The authors estimated impacts using a multivariate regression framework.","","The study found that, compared with those in the control group, treatment group members were 18.6 percentage points more likely to ever be self-employed over the follow-up period (47.2 percent compared with 28.6 percent). Treatment group members also, on average, entered self-employment 2.2 months faster and were self-employed 1.5 months longer than those in the control group. These differences were statistically significant. However, they did not translate into statistically significant differences in monthly earnings from self-employment or total earnings from self-employment over the follow-up period.
Conversely, treatment group members were no more or less likely than control group members to enter wage and salary employment over the follow-up period. However, they did stay employed 1.3 months longer and earn $5,364 more in wage and salary employment than control group members, on average. These differences were statistically significant.
The Enterprise Project reduced the length of the first UI spell by 2.1 weeks and reduced the amount of UI benefits received during that spell by an average of $718.","The study included only claimants who passed an extensive screening process and expressed interest and motivation to enter self-employment. The economic situation in Massachusetts changed during the study period from relative health in 1990 to a recession by the end of 1991. The authors noted that previous experience suggested that a higher unemployment rate makes people more interested in self-employment.","",""

Sixty-three participants volunteered for the study, which they were told involved participating in writing activities to help them with their job search. The authors randomly assigned 41 participants to either the writing treatment group (20) or the writing control group (21). Participants in the treatment group wrote about their thoughts and feelings about being laid off for 20 minutes every day for five consecutive days. These participants were instructed to engage deeply with their emotions during the writing. Those in the writing control group also wrote for 20 minutes every day for five consecutive days. However, they were instructed to write about their plans for their day and avoid writing about their opinions or feelings about being laid off. An additional group of 22 participants who volunteered for the study but were unable to attend the writing sessions were assigned to a non-writing comparison group. This group did not participate in any daily writing activities known to the researchers. Subjects in all three study groups had access to outplacement job services and an outplacement consultant throughout the project.

Courses were provided on site by teachers who specialized in adult education. Classes met twice per week for two hours and were taught in five 8- to 12-week sessions. Employees were paid their regular wages during class time, and signing up was voluntary. Classes were taught during regular shift times, so employees could participate only if their absence would not disrupt the work flow. Subjects covered in the training included basic skills, such as reading, writing, math, and English as a second language. In addition, the training at the manufacturing company included occupational skills classes, such as blueprint math and blueprint reading.","The authors used regression analyses to compare the wage growth of workers who participated in training with the wage growth of workers who did not participate.

Six sites were selected purposively for the study; all UI claimants in these sites underwent a sequence of intake activities to screen out those with insufficient interest in or motivation for self-employment. The study excluded claimants filing interstate claims, those filing claims backdated more than 14 days, those who were employer-attached on standby or who were full-referral union members, and those younger than 18.
The study included a total of 1,507 approved applicants, 755 of whom were randomly assigned to the treatment group and 752 to the control group. SEED participants were offered three types of program services: (1) business start-up training and technical assistance, (2) a waiver of the UI work search requirements and documentation typically required to continue receiving UI benefits, and (3) financial assistance in the form of self-employment allowances equivalent to their UI benefits and payment in full of remaining benefits when they exited UI.
The researchers used data from a follow-up telephone survey administered to all study participants about 21 months after random assignment. The survey captured data on employment and earnings, unemployment, time spent looking for work, and SEED program experiences.

The study used a regression model to compare the percentage change in injury rates when firms had received inspections that resulted in penalties during the past four years and when the same firms had not received penalties during the past four years.
The study found that inspections that resulted in penalties were associated with statistically significant reductions in lost workday injuries (by 22 percent) and lost workdays (by 20 percent) during the three years following the inspection.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this study is low. This means we are not confident that the changes in injury rates within firms when they received inspections that resulted in penalties are attributable solely to these penalties.","","The study examined the effect on injury rates of OSHA inspections that resulted in penalties during the 1980s. The study analyzed the effect of having an inspection that resulted in penalties in the current year, the previous year, two years earlier, and three years earlier on (1) lost workday injuries (that is, injuries that resulted in being unable to work or restricted work activity) per 100 employees and (2) lost workdays per 100 employees. Although OSHA no longer operates as it did during this period, this study provides historical context for changes that were later made to the program.","The study used a regression model with firm fixed effects to compare the percentage change in injury rates when firms had received inspections that resulted in penalties during the past four years and when the same firms had not received penalties during the past four years. The model included controls for employment and hours, which varied over the study period. The authors used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics annual injury survey and OSHA’s Management Information System for 6,842 manufacturing plants from 1981 to 1985.","Inspections that resulted in penalties were associated with statistically significant reductions in lost workday injuries (by 22 percent) and lost workdays (by 20 percent) during the following three years.","In this study, the estimated changes in injury rates may reflect underlying differences in safety levels or changes in other factors over time, rather than the impact of inspections that result in penalties. Penalties are assessed when an inspection uncovers OSHA violations; therefore, the years when firms received a penalty may have been marked by more egregious safety violations that would have been addressed by management over time, even absent the inspection and penalty, than the years when firms did not receive penalties or were not inspected. In addition, the model does not include controls for year, so the estimated differences in injuries could reflect changes over time in OSHA’s policies regarding inspections and penalties, which could be associated with secular changes in workplace safety.","",""

About 2,300 youth were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which was eligible to participate in JOBSTART, or the control group, which could not participate in JOBSTART but could access other services in the community. The authors compared the outcomes of the treatment and control groups using data collected through follow-up surveys 12, 24, and 48 months after random assignment.
The study found that, 48 months after random assignment, members of the treatment group were significantly more likely to have participated in education or training, and completed significantly more hours of it, compared with the control group. The treatment group was significantly less likely to be employed and earned significantly less than the control group in the first year after random assignment. There were no significant impacts on earnings or employment outcomes in later follow-up years.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it is based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the JOBSTART program, and not to other factors.","","JOBSTART was implemented in 13 sites nationwide from 1985 to 1989. It provided a combination of basic skills education, occupational training, support services, and job placement assistance for low-skilled school dropouts. To be eligible for the program, youth had to be ages 17 to 21 years old; have dropped out of school without earning a high school diploma or General Educational Development (GED) certificate; have reading skills below the 8th-grade level; and be economically disadvantaged.
The program was voluntary and intended for participants to receive at least 200 hours of basic skills education and 500 hours of occupational training. The basic skills education prepared youth to obtain a GED certificate and, thereafter, begin occupational skills training. Participants completed workbook exercises in reading, mathematics, and other subjects included on the GED test. As part of the occupational training component, youth attended vocational skills courses that offered training for specific occupations. JOBSTART also offered support services, such as child care and transportation assistance, to facilitate participation. When participants completed their education and training, JOBSTART offered them job placement assistance. In the study, participants spent an average of 125 hours in education, 238 hours in training, and 27 hours in other activities—totaling about 400 hours of programming per person over roughly six months, on average.","The 2,312 youth who met eligibility criteria and consented to participate in the program were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which was offered the opportunity to participate in the JOBSTART program, or the control group, which could not participate in the JOBSTART program but could access other services available in the community. The authors conducted follow-up surveys 12, 24, and 48 months after random assignment with both the treatment and control groups. This study focused on data from the 48-month follow-up survey, to which 988 treatment and 953 control group members responded. Using this follow-up survey data, the authors estimated regression models comparing the outcomes of treatment and control group members and controlling for relevant baseline characteristics.","The study found that 48 months after random assignment, members of the treatment group were 17 percentage points more likely to have completed a GED, 13 percentage points more likely to have completed a GED or high school diploma, and 16 percentage points more likely to have received a trade certificate or license, compared with the control group members. These differences were statistically significant.
Members of the treatment group completed 367 more hours of education or training than the control group members as of 48 months after random assignment, which was a statistically significant difference. These findings were driven by differences between the two groups in the first 24 months following random assignment; differences in later follow-up periods were not statistically significant.
The study found that treatment group members earned $499 less, were 4 percentage points less likely to be employed, and worked 109 fewer hours than the control group in the first year following random assignment. In later follow-up years, however, there were no significant differences between the groups on earnings or employment outcomes.","The authors suggested that the negative findings in earnings and employment domains in the first year following random assignment are indicative of participants being more involved in program activities and therefore having less time to work outside the program. Similarly, the positive impacts on training and education outcomes were limited to the first two years after random assignment, when participants were most likely to be involved in such activities through JOBSTART itself.","",""

In this demonstration, about 15,000 eligible claimants were randomly assigned to one of six treatment groups with varying financial incentives and qualification periods or a control group. For all participants, the study team collected administrative data, which provided information on UI benefits receipt, employment, and earnings. The study team also surveyed a subsample of approximately 5,000 participants about their experiences in the year following random assignment.
The study found that two of the bonus treatments reduced the weeks of UI benefits and total UI benefit dollars received, but the others did not. The study found very few impacts of the bonus treatments on claimants’ reemployment rates or earnings.
The quality of causal evidence is high for UI benefits receipt outcomes because it is based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to reemployment bonus incentives, and not to other factors. However, the quality of causal evidence is moderate for the employment and earnings outcomes because study attrition could not be determined for those outcomes.","Absence of conflict of interest: This study was conducted by staff from Mathematica Policy Research, which administers CLEAR. Therefore, the review of this study was conducted by an independent consultant trained in applying the CLEAR causal evidence guidelines.","Implemented in 12 randomly selected offices across Pennsylvania, the demonstration restricted eligibility to UI claimants who had filed within the past two weeks, did not have a definite recall date to their former employer, and did not routinely obtain employment through a union hiring hall. The demonstration had six different bonus offerings. The first four entailed different combinations of reemployment bonus amounts—either three or six times the UI weekly benefit amount—and periods within which participants were required to find a job in order to claim the bonus, known as a qualification period. The qualification period was either 6 or 12 weeks. The fifth type of bonus declined from the high amount (six times the weekly benefit amount) to zero over the course of the benefit period, and the sixth was essentially the same as the fourth, except that it excluded the offer of a job search workshop, which was available to all five other bonus groups. To claim any bonus, claimants needed to maintain employment for four months.","About 15,000 eligible UI claimants from 1988 and 1989 were randomly assigned to either receive the offer of one of the six reemployment bonuses or to an existing services control group, which was not offered a reemployment bonus and continued to receive weekly UI benefits payments subject to existing requirements. The study estimated the average difference between treatment and control group members on measures of UI benefits receipt, reemployment, and earnings using data from UI administrative records and a survey administered to about 5,000 participants. Because the only difference between the fourth and sixth bonus groups was that the sixth group was not offered a job search workshop, the two were combined in the analysis.
The authors estimated impacts by comparing the outcomes of each treatment group to the outcomes of the control group. Regression models controlled for weekly UI benefits amount, base period earnings, potential UI duration, gender, age, race, office, and recall expectations.","The study found that the claimants offered the lower of the two bonuses (three times the weekly benefit amount) and the shorter three-week qualification received UI benefits for 0.7 fewer weeks than the control group, for a reduction in UI benefits received of $103. These differences were statistically significant.
Claimants offered the higher of the two bonuses (six times the weekly benefit amount) and the longer six-week qualification period received UI benefits for 0.8 fewer weeks and received $130 less than control group members. These differences were statistically significant.
None of the other treatment groups saw statistically significant impacts on UI benefits receipt outcomes.
Two of 80 short-term reemployment impacts estimated were statistically significant, as were 2 of 40 short-term earnings impacts estimated. This is roughly what would be expected by chance.","The UI benefits receipt outcomes are based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial and so receive a high evidence rating. However, attrition could not be determined for the reemployment and earnings outcomes based on either administrative or survey data. The authors included sufficient control variables in their regression models to receive a moderate evidence rating for these outcomes.
In addition, most of the statistically significant findings reported are based on one-tailed tests; CLEAR’s standard is to use a two-tailed test. Because actual p-values are not reported, we cannot determine how many of these results would remain significant after adjusting for a two-tailed test, but presumably it is fewer.
The labor market and UI program have changed considerably since this study was conducted. Therefore, a similar study conducted in the current environment might find different results.","",""

The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is high because it is based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the reemployment bonuses, and not to other factors.","","The experiment in Washington was implemented in 21 of the job service centers operating in Washington at the time. Six different bonus offerings were available to eligible UI claimants. These resulted from different combinations of reemployment bonus amounts—either two, four, or six times the UI weekly benefits amount—and periods within which participants were required to find a job in order to claim the bonus, known as a qualification period. The qualification period was either 7 or 13 weeks. To claim the bonus, participants had to secure a job within the qualification period and maintain it for four months.","From February to November 1988, 15,541 new UI claimants were randomly assigned into one of the six reemployment bonus groups or a control group. Participants randomly assigned to the control group received the same weekly UI benefits payments over the same maximum weeks of eligibility, but were not offered a reemployment bonus. The study estimated the average difference between each of the treatment groups and the control group on measures of UI benefits receipt using data from UI administrative records. They also analyzed pooled treatment groups consisting of those with the same benefit amount (but different qualification periods) and all treatment groups together.","The study found that three of the bonus treatments—high benefits with short qualification period, low benefits with long qualification period, and high benefits with long qualification period—reduced weeks of UI receipt by 0.6 to 0.8 weeks and total amount of UI received by $107 to $142 compared with the control group. These differences were statistically significant.
Pooling across all bonus treatments, treatment group members received 0.4 fewer weeks and $65 less in UI benefits, on average, than their control group counterparts, and these differences were statistically significant.
Only the low benefits and long qualification period treatment group experienced a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of claimants exhausting benefits, of 3.2 percentage points, relative to the control group.","The authors also examined the impact of the reemployment bonuses on the quarterly earnings for the subgroup of study participants who terminated UI benefits before exhaustion and had nonzero wages in both the full quarter before filing for benefits and the one after termination of benefits. They found no statistically significant impacts of the reemployment bonus on earnings in any treatment group. However, because these impacts were examined only among those who found employment, they should not be interpreted as causal. In addition, the labor market and UI program have changed considerably since this study was conducted. Therefore, a similar study conducted in the current environment might find different results.","",""

The study used data from the New Jersey Unemployment Insurance Reemployment Demonstration Project. For the demonstration, about 11,000 UI claimants were randomized into one of three treatment groups, all of which received some variation of Job Search Assistance (JSA) services, or into the control group, which could receive only existing services in the community. The author estimated weekly UI exit rates from state UI administrative records.
The study found that the JSA-plus-reemployment-bonus group members were more likely than members of the JSA-only group to leave UI for a new job during weeks 7 through 12, which corresponded to the first half of the bonus qualification period, suggesting the bonuses were effective in spurring UI claimants to find new jobs more quickly.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is moderate because it is a secondary analysis of data from a well-implemented randomized controlled trial for which attrition cannot be calculated. However, the author included sufficient statistical controls to receive a moderate evidence rating. This means we have some confidence that the estimated effects are attributable to the interventions studied, although other factors also could have contributed.","","Implemented in 10 randomly selected UI offices across New Jersey, the demonstration mandated participation in JSA services for displaced workers who were recently unemployed to foster their quick reemployment. The demonstration had three service offerings: (1) JSA only; (2) JSA plus training or relocation services; and (3) JSA plus a reemployment bonus. All three interventions shared the same JSA components: an orientation session and testing; five half-day job-search workshop sessions at local New Jersey UI offices; a one-on-one counseling and assessment session with office staff; and a requirement to maintain contact with the demonstration office, either by discussing job-search activities with office staff or using the office’s resource center to conduct job-search activities.
The JSA-only group received no services other than JSA services. In the JSA-plus-training group, staff informed participants about training and relocation services available and helped participants plan their training options. In the JSA-plus-reemployment-bonus group, participants who became reemployed quickly received a bonus equal to one-half of their remaining UI entitlement at the time of the assessment if they found employment within two weeks. The bonus declined in value by 10 percent of the original amount per week. Participants received 60 percent of the bonus if they held the job for 4 weeks; they received all of it if they were employed for 12 weeks. Bonuses were not available to claimants who were rehired by their former employer; were employed by a relative; or were in temporary, seasonal, or part-time work.
Eligibility screening for the demonstration excluded claimants who (1) had not received their first UI payment, had their first payment more than five weeks after their initial claim, had a partial first payment, or a special type of claim (such as a claim by an ex-service member); (2) were younger than 25 years old; (3) had been on their previous job for fewer than three years; (4) had a specific date for being recalled by their former employers; and (5) who were typically hired through union hiring halls.","For the demonstration, all those eligible were randomly assigned to the JSA-only group (2,416 participants), JSA-plus-training group (3,810 participants), JSA-plus-reemployment-bonus group (2,449 participants), or the control group (2,385 participants). This study focused on when and at what rate UI claimants in the JSA-only and JSA-plus-reemployment-bonus groups left the UI rolls.
The study used hazard models to understand the influence of the reemployment bonus on two competing risks—leaving UI for a new job and leaving UI in response to recall from a previous employer—in each of four time periods: before week 7 (which was before the bonus offer for the JSA-plus-bonus group), weeks 7 through 12 (roughly the first half of the bonus period), weeks 13 through 18 (roughly the second half of the bonus period), and after week 18 (after the bonus period). The author hypothesized that, if the reemployment bonuses worked as intended, bonus-eligible claimants would have faster exit rates during the bonus period than those who were not bonus-eligible, but this could differ depending on claimants’ expectations of being recalled to their previous jobs. A second hypothesis held that if the JSA services were effective, those offered JSA should have higher exit rates over all periods than members of the control group.","The study found that the JSA-plus-reemployment-bonus group members were more likely than members of the JSA-only group to leave UI for a new job during weeks 7 through12, which corresponded to the first half of the bonus qualification period, suggesting the bonuses were effective in spurring UI claimants to find new jobs more quickly. The study did not find any statistically significant differences between the JSA-only and control groups in UI exit rates.
Across all research groups, UI claimants who expected to be recalled to a previous job were much more likely to be recalled and much less likely to exit UI for a new job. Over time, those who expected to be recalled but were not began to give up on their old jobs, and their probability of exiting UI for a new job increased.","The study’s contribution was to test whether the effectiveness of JSA treatments could vary based on whether the UI claimant expected to be recalled to a job with a previous employer. Therefore, although the data analyzed in this study originated from a well-implemented randomized controlled trial, the author excluded observations of some participants for whom expectations of recall were missing. However, information about observations that were excluded from particular study groups was not presented in the study, making it impossible to determine attrition and making the study ineligible for a high causal evidence rating.","",""

The authors compared the probability that minority candidates applied to and were hired for managerial positions at firms that were and were not subject to affirmative action reporting requirements. The sample comprised 99 Detroit firms that fully responded to the 1972 Detroit Area Study survey.
The study found that firms subject to affirmative action reporting requirements were significantly more likely to hire African American males than firms not subject to the requirements.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the authors did not adequately control for existing differences between firms that were and were not subject to affirmative action reporting requirements. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to affirmative action reporting requirements. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, employers may not discriminate against their employees on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, or national origin. The law prohibits discrimination in terms, compensation, working conditions, and other aspects of employment; mandates enforcement by courts, rather than juries; and provides civil penalties for violations, including mandatory remedial hiring policies for employers and reinstatement with back pay awards to victims.
Title VII also created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to bring class action litigation against employers for discrimination. Employers meeting certain size requirements must submit EEO-1 or Employer Information Report files to the EEOC and the Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. These reports are establishment-level responses to annual workforce surveys. Before 1982, private employers with at least 50 employees and federal contractors with at least 25 employees were required to file EEO-1 reports; since then, the size requirements have risen to 100 or 50 employees, respectively.","The authors applied multinomial logistic regression models to data from 99 Detroit firms providing complete data in the 1972 Detroit Area Study. One model estimated the probability that race and gender subgroups applied for managerial positions at each firm. A second model estimated the probability that an applicant belonged to a race or gender subgroup, given that he or she was ultimately hired. All regression models controlled for organizational characteristics, including revenue growth, corporation size, management position characteristics, and whether the firm’s workforce was unionized. The models also controlled for attributes of the current workforce, including the employment share of females and African American males in the managerial workforce. Because the hiring of these workers depended partly on whether they applied, the hiring model included as additional controls the log of the ratio of the probability that an applicant was African American to the probability that an applicant was white, for both men and women.","The study found that firms subject to affirmative action reporting requirements were significantly more likely to hire African American males than were uncovered firms. Specifically, given that an applicant was ultimately hired, the probability that the new hire was an African American male was higher among regulated than unregulated firms.
Women were significantly more likely to apply for managerial positions at covered firms than at uncovered firms, but the probability of hiring female managers did not differ by coverage status.","The authors did not establish the baseline comparability of the firms that were and were not subject to affirmative action reporting requirements in terms of minority application and hiring. Although they controlled for existing differences in race and gender managerial employment, it is not clear that these differences predated the firm’s coverage by these requirements. In addition, differential response rates to the survey might have caused differences between the two types of firms. The sample design was based on 212 Detroit area firms; 132 responded to the survey and only 99 provided complete data. If firms subject to affirmative action reporting requirements were more likely to respond to the survey when they were in compliance with the requirements, the findings would reflect this difference between the two groups of firms as well as the effect of the requirements.","",""

The study found that UI claimants facing less-stringent work search requirements received more UI benefits for longer and were more likely to exhaust their benefits, on average, than those facing standard work search requirements.

This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the alternative work search requirements, and not to other factors.","","The Washington Alternative Work Search Experiment was implemented through the Tacoma, Washington Job Service Center. A total of 9,634 new, eligible UI claimants from July 1986 to August 1987 were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups or a control group. Control group members faced standard work search requirements typical in most states at the time: they were required to make at least three employer contacts per week in their primary industry and to participate in eligibility review interviews focused on work-search activities 13 to 15 weeks after filing initial claims.
The three treatment groups represented adjustments to the standard work search requirements:
In the exception reporting treatment, claimants received their customary weekly benefits unless they reported a change in status. They were encouraged to participate in work-search activities but were not obligated to report on those efforts.
In the new work search policy treatment, claimants were subject to personalized work-search requirements that intensified as their UI spell continued. Members of this group who remained unemployed participated in eligibility review interviews to develop employability strategies.
In the intensive services treatment, claimants who remained unemployed after receiving benefits for 4 weeks were required to attend a two-day job search training session. Those who were still unemployed after 12 weeks were required to attend an eligibility review interview to develop employability strategies.
Data for the study were collected from Washington State Employment Security Department databases and a survey administered at the time of random assignment. The authors estimated the average differences between each of the treatment groups and the control group on measures of UI benefit amount, duration of UI receipt, employment, earnings, hours worked, and hourly wages.","","Members of the exception reporting treatment group, who faced less-stringent work search requirements than the standard work search group, received $265 more in UI benefit payments, remained on UI for approximately three weeks longer, and were 13 percentage points more likely to exhaust UI benefits than members of the control group. These differences were statistically significant.
Members of the exception reporting treatment group earned $0.28 more per hour than members of the control group in the first quarter after the initial claim, but these increased hourly earnings did not translate into significantly higher total earnings, nor did they persist past the first quarter.
The new work search policy and intensive services treatment groups had UI benefits receipt, employment, and earnings outcomes that were no better or worse than those of the control groups, on average.","The study authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to UI benefits receipt, earnings, and employment. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. Because the authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, the number of statistically significant impacts for the exception reporting treatment group is likely to be overstated.","",""

Nevertheless, the study provides interesting historical context. At the time of this study, OSHA conducted inspections for four reasons: as part of a general schedule of inspections targeted to high-hazard firms; if a complaint had been filed by employees or their representatives; if there had been an injury or fatality; or as a follow-up to a previous inspection. The authors noted that complaint and follow-up inspections were generally less intensive than general inspections. An inspector could issue citations for violations of safety standards observed during the inspection. Depending on the nature of the violation(s), the inspector might also issue a monetary penalty. Those firms with more violations were more likely to receive subsequent inspections to determine whether the violations had been corrected.
The outcomes of interest to the study were the number of hazards at later OSHA reinspections of the same firm and the number of test samples collected at the inspection that exceeded permitted exposure limits as an outcome of interest.","The authors estimated regression models to compare the number of hazards found at the first, second, and higher-order inspections conducted by OSHA in manufacturing firms from 1972 to 1983. The specific models selected by the authors were chosen to fit the context of the analysis and included Poisson, negative binomial, and log-linear models with firm-fixed effects. Fixed effects control for non-time-varying differences across firms that could influence both their compliance behavior and the probability of being reinspected. The models also controlled for the source of an inspection, whether a general inspection or all other inspection types. Finally, the models included indicators for presidential administration; these accounted for prominent changes in OSHA inspection procedures over the period of study.
The authors used data from OSHA’s Integrated Management Information System for 12,592 plants with two or more inspections from 1972 to 1983. There were 35,426 observations, each representing an inspection.","The study found that the number of hazards identified decreased sharply from the first to the second OSHA inspection.
The average firm inspected two or more times from 1972 to 1983 experienced a reduction in citations of 50 percent and a reduction in overexposures of 42 percent over this period.","The authors’ empirical strategy relied on comparing the change in hazards identified from one inspection to the next within the same firm, giving us confidence that the observed effects were caused by the inspection and not underlying differences between firms. Given that inspections occured for different reasons, the authors also included controls for the type of inspection. And, because inspections with higher sequence numbers necessarily occurred later in time, the authors also accounted for secular changes in inspection procedures over time. To do this, they included controls for presidential administration, using indicator variables for inspections during the Nixon/Ford presidencies and the Carter presidency. Ko et al. (2010) demonstrated that, although there were small changes in OSHA activities within presidential administrations, the largest changes occurred after the election of a new president.
The empirical approach and carefully selected set of control variables employed in the analysis give us confidence that the authors have attempted to account for the likely sources of bias. In other words, conditional on the control variables, there is little reason to believe that inspections with different sequence numbers differ in any systematic way within the same firm.","",""

In this demonstration, about 11,000 UI claimants were randomized into one of three treatment groups, all of which received some variation of Job Search Assistance (JSA) services, or into the control group, which could receive only existing services in the community. For all participants, the study team collected administrative data, which provided information on UI receipt, employment, and earnings.
The study found that, over the claim year and three follow-up years, the JSA-plus-reemployment-bonus group had statistically significant differences from the control group on UI dollars received ($293 fewer than control) and UI weeks paid (1.6 fewer weeks than control). The study found few statistically significant impacts on the probability of working, earnings, or weeks worked for any of the treatment groups compared with the control group.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the interventions studied, and not to other factors.","Absence of conflict of interest: This study was conducted by staff from Mathematica Policy Research, which administers CLEAR. Therefore, the review of this study was conducted by an independent consultant trained in applying the CLEAR causal evidence guidelines.","Implemented in 10 randomly selected UI offices across New Jersey, the demonstration mandated participation in JSA services for displaced workers who were recently unemployed to foster their quick reemployment. The demonstration had three service offerings: (1) JSA-only; (2) JSA plus training or relocation services; and (3) JSA plus a reemployment bonus. All three interventions shared the same JSA components: an orientation session and testing; five half-day job-search workshop sessions at local New Jersey UI offices; a one-on-one counseling and assessment session with office staff; and a requirement to maintain contact with the demonstration office, either by discussing job-search activities with office staff or using the office’s resource center to conduct job-search activities.
The JSA-only group received no services other than JSA services. In the JSA-plus-training group, staff informed participants about training and relocation services available and helped participants plan their training options. In the JSA-plus-reemployment-bonus group, participants who became reemployed quickly received a bonus equal to one-half of the person’s remaining UI entitlement at the time of the assessment if he or she found employment within two weeks; and the bonus declined in value by 10 percent of the original amount per week. Participants received 60 percent of the bonus if they held the job for four weeks, and received all of it if they were employed for 12 weeks. Bonuses were not available to claimants who were rehired by their former employers; were employed by a relative; or were in temporary, seasonal, or part-time work.
Eligibility screening for the demonstration excluded claimants who (1) had not received their first UI payment, had their first payment more than five weeks after their initial claim, had a partial first payment, or a special type of claim (such as a claim by an ex-service member); (2) were younger than 25 years old; (3) had been on their previous job for fewer than three years; (4) had specific dates for being recalled by their former employers; and (5) were typically hired through union hiring halls.","All those eligible for the demonstration were randomly assigned to the JSA-only group (2,416 participants), JSA-plus-training group (3,810 participants), JSA-plus-reemployment-bonus group (2,449 participants), or the control group (2,385 participants). Administrative UI data were collected from initial intake into the study (sometime from July 1986 to June 1987) through June 1990. Data on employment and earnings came from quarterly wage records through the first quarter of 1990.
To measure impacts on UI receipt, employment, and earnings, the authors compared the outcomes of members of each of the three treatment groups with those of the control group.","The study found that, cumulatively over the claim year and three follow-up years, the JSA-plus-reemployment-bonus group had statistically significant differences from the control group on UI dollars received ($293 fewer than control) and UI weeks paid (1.6 fewer weeks than control); these differences were driven by the impacts in the early years of the demonstration.
The study found no statistically significant impacts on the probability of UI receipt over the initial claim year or three follow-up years.
Of the approximately 90 employment and earnings outcomes examined over the follow-up period for each of the treatment groups, 4 were statistically significant.","The authors estimated multiple related impacts in the UI benefit receipt, employment, and earnings domains. Doing so increased the probability of identifying statistically significant differences by chance. Therefore, the number of statistically significant findings in these domains was probably overstated.
Only 15 percent of the JSA-plus-training group participated in training. In addition, the authors noted that not all sample members completed follow-up data. Finally, the labor market, UI program, and reemployment services have changed considerably since this study was conducted. Therefore, a similar study conducted in the current environment might find different results.","",""

The authors conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Researchers administered a pre-test two weeks before the intervention and three post-tests at 1, 4, and 30 months after the intervention comparing the outcomes of Jobs Program participants against a control group.
The study found no statistically significant relationships between the Jobs Program and increased long-term earnings or time in work during the follow-up period.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low because the study was an RCT with post-intervention subsampling based on participation in the intervention. In addition, the authors did not include sufficient controls in their analysis. This means we are not confident that any estimated effects would be attributable to the Jobs Program; however, the study found no statistically significant effects.","","The Jobs Program consisted of eight three-hour sessions conducted on four mornings of each of two weeks. Sessions were led by male-female pairs of trainers who had received about 80 hours of formal training and were regularly observed by members of the research team. Sessions focused on (1) establishing trust in the trainers, (2) building participants’ self-esteem and motivation, and (3) teaching specific job search skills. Skills targeted included identifying and effectively expressing competencies, using social connections to find job leads, contacting potential employers, preparing applications, and interviewing.
In addition to teaching job search skills, the intervention focused on the mental and emotional well-being of participants. Session time was dedicated to “psychologically inoculating” participants against losing their motivation in the face of prolonged unemployment by teaching problem-solving skills designed to help participants anticipate setbacks and adapt when they arose. Trainers also offered direct encouragement and support during the intervention and provided opportunities for other participants to support one another.","The authors conducted an RCT, randomly assigning 1,122 people to either treatment or control groups. Those in the treatment group were given the opportunity to attend the Jobs Program, whereas those in the control group were provided with self-instructional materials on general job search strategies. Study participants were recruited from four unemployment compensation offices across southern Michigan. The recruitment process limited the study to people who were applying for or receiving unemployment compensation in the state. Individuals were considered ineligible to participate if they were within two years of retirement, expected to be recalled to their previous job, were judged by experimenters as showing clear indications of mental illness, or reported being unemployed for more than four months. Researchers administered a pre-test two weeks before the intervention began and two post-tests one and four months after the intervention ended. Impacts were estimated by comparing unadjusted treatment and control group means.","The study found no statistically significant relationships between the Jobs Program and long-term earnings or time in work during the follow-up period.","Attrition is difficult to discern in this study because the authors did not provide sample sizes by treatment condition at each follow-up and presented different sample sizes in different studies describing the same experiment. However, the fact that only a subset of participants who were assigned to the Jobs Program but dropped out were sampled for the follow-up surveys means that random assignment was compromised and the study cannot receive a high causal evidence rating. This is because the decision to participate in Jobs occurred after random assignment; to preserve the integrity of the random assignment process, the authors would have had to attempt to survey all of those randomly assigned to the Jobs Program, including all those who did not ultimately participate in it.
Compromised RCTs can receive a moderate causal evidence rating if they include controls for demographic and pre-intervention variables specified in CLEAR’s topic area review protocol. Because the study did not include all the required controls in the analysis, it cannot receive a moderate causal evidence rating. In particular, the study did not include controls for employment stability, pre-intervention employment, or earnings measured more than one year before random assignment.","",""

Although OSHA no longer operates as it did during the period examined, this study provides historical context for changes that were later made to the program. The study also considered the impact of OSHA’s record-checking procedure, initiated in 1981, on lost-workday injury rates. Under this procedure, inspections by OSHA of firms in manufacturing industries with above average lost-workday injury rates (dubbed “high-risk”) followed a two-step procedure. First, a compliance officer would inspect an establishment’s records to determine past-year injury rates. If the injury rate exceeded a threshold, the establishment was then inspected in full. Otherwise, the planned inspection was terminated.","The study used a regression model to examine differences in injury rates for firms that received inspections in March and April and those that received inspections in November and December of the same year. To determine the impact of being subject to the records-check procedure, the model included an indicator for the establishment’s industry having been designated as “high-risk,” an indicator for the records-check procedure being in place, and the interaction of these variables. The model also included controls for the lost-workday injury rate in the prior year, changes in employment over time, establishment size, two-digit industry classification, and year. The analyses were based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Annual Survey of Injuries and Illnesses, the Federal OSHA Management Information System, and County Business Patterns publications on 4,114 manufacturing establishments inspected by state or federal OSHA regulators in March, April, November, or December between 1980 and 1985.","Relative to late OSHA inspections, early OSHA inspections were not associated with a statistically significant reduction in injury rates within the year of inspection.
There was no evidence that the records-checking procedure led to differences in the reported injury rates.","In this study, the authors argued that, given that a firm is inspected, the time of year in which it is inspected is likely random. However, in 1978, OSHA developed a system for conducting inspections based on administrative data. This system prioritized inspections at potentially more dangerous firms over the course of the year. Thus, firms inspected earlier in the year might have been more hazardous than those inspected later in the year. In addition, firms subject to the records-checking procedure might differ from those that would be inspected using different procedures. In particular, the records checking procedure was used only in states where OSHA inspections were federally-administered. Therefore, it is unclear whether the lack of statistically significant findings reflects a true lack of association between inspections and injury rates or is attributable to differences between the groups being compared.","",""

To achieve this goal, the demonstration provided participants with short-term training for potentially permanent jobs in which they would conduct tasks for their employers and interact with nondisabled colleagues.
The study developed findings on recruitment, training, placement, and the provision of other services by collecting data from all eight program sites. It drew on several qualitative sources, such as program staff interviews, observations of service provision, and program documents, as well as a few quantitative sources, including program, survey, and SSI administrative data.
The study found that it was feasible to successfully place a wide variety of SSI recipients with intellectual disabilities in mainstream jobs using transitional employment services. However, the programs faced several challenges in program design and implementation. Recruitment and job placement could be difficult, given opinions among caregivers and employers that people with intellectual disabilities cannot perform well in competitive jobs. Job placement was hampered further by the lack of suitable transportation options.","","The Social Security Administration launched the Transitional Employment Training Demonstration in 1985, awarding grants to eight organizations in eight states to help SSI recipients with intellectual disabilities obtain and retain competitive employment. In total, 745 SSI recipients were recruited for the demonstration, about 5 percent of those who were eligible. Its key strategies were to (1) place participants in potentially permanent positions in which they would be able to conduct all relevant tasks and interact with those who were not disabled; (2) provide short-duration training on specific job functions, general job-related capabilities such as task and time management, and social and life skills needed in the workplace; (3) provide ongoing monitoring and job retention services; and (4) provide any supplementary services needed, such as transportation or travel training.
Sites tried to ensure that their participants were positioned for success at their places of employment by working with employers to ensure that participants were given time to grow into their roles and achieve regular production rates, facilitating connections between participants and other employees, modifying jobs so that they met the needs of those with intellectual disabilities, and matching participants to jobs that aligned closely with their interests and capabilities.","The effectiveness of the demonstration was evaluated using a randomized controlled trial (see link here for the CLEAR profile of the study containing those results). The process study summarized in this profile used data from the universe of sites to understand how to improve training to advance employment outcomes and align services more effectively with the needs of those with intellectual disabilities, all while ensuring that services remained cost-efficient. Qualitative data were collected through (1) the review of the standard operating procedures and financial reports of each site, (2) interviews with site managers and other personnel, (3) participation in joint meetings with staff from all sites, and (4) observations of intake interviews and trainings. The evaluators also drew on quantitative data on the beneficiaries to provide context. Sources included survey and SSI administrative data on earnings and benefit payments, site data on program costs, and data on job retention from an unspecified source. The article implied that these data were collected over the course of the two-year program implementation period.","The process study found that the demonstration was generally successful in finding placements for participants in jobs in which they could succeed. At the end of the program, 34 percent of the participants were in permanent jobs, earning an average of $111 per week. Program costs—also a focus for the study—averaged $7,650 per participant, but the authors estimated that the same services would cost about $5,600 when provided by a longer-term operation, given about $2,000 in costs per participant that went toward initiating and phasing out the demonstration. Summarized next are lessons on specific program components and phases.
Recruitment. Sites found recruitment challenging and were able to recruit only 5 percent of those eligible for the demonstration. The authors discussed several possible explanations. First, parents might have been unconvinced of the appropriateness of transitional employment for their special needs children, and concerned that needed supports would not be available beyond the lifespan of the demonstration. Another (unsubstantiated) concern among potential participants might have been that program participation could lead to the determination that they were not disabled and therefore ineligible for SSI benefits. Finally, other agencies were reluctant to provide referrals, either because they were competing for similar participants or because they had the same concerns about transitional employment as parents of SSI recipients.
Screening. It was challenging to predict up front whether participants would benefit from the program, which led to higher program costs. In general, the study found that subjective assessments of the participants’ enthusiasm, the availability of external supports, and generally, the likelihood of the participants succeeding at the workplace, were better predictors of participants’ progress than quantifiable factors such as intelligence quotient scores or the presence of secondary disabling conditions.
Job development. Many employers were not open to offering transitional employment positions. Exceptions were the food service and hotel industries, which were more willing than other industries to consider hiring workers with special needs. However, they also offered multitask jobs such as dishwashing that were more difficult for those with intellectual disabilities to undertake.
Job placement and training. Placements in potentially permanent positions were more successful than placements in training-only positions. In permanent placements, job coaches could help trainees adjust to the exact environment in which they would be working long term—providing training on very specific job tasks, facilitating communication with other employees, and ensuring that needed supplementary services were in place. By contrast, in training-only jobs, participants had to apply what they learned in one position to another and adapt to new settings, schedulers, and coworkers. Training-only positions were more cost-efficient and easier to arrange (especially when they were at the grantee’s own facilities) and catered to participants with particularly severe handicaps who needed extra time to adapt to a work setting.
Transportation. The lack of suitable transportation options led to participants undertaking difficult commutes, taking nearer jobs to which they were not ideally suited, not being placed at all, and even being screened out of the program entirely. Sites drew on both public and private means of transportation to meet participants’ needs and devoted considerable time and resources to travel training—even having coaches put participants on buses in person.
Job coaches. Job coaches took on wide-ranging responsibilities, even picking up production shortfalls experienced by the participants in early days at the job to ensure employers’ satisfaction and increased chances of job retention. The job coaches had highly varied experience and expertise; however, the study found that even those who did not have relevant educational or professional qualifications, and who were therefore the most inexpensive to hire, were effective in their roles as long as they received appropriate supervision.
Adapting services to participants’ needs. Meeting the needs of the demonstration’s diverse participants required a flexible approach to program design and service provision. Services that were not required components of the program—such as case management—were needed to address the challenges faced by beneficiaries with intellectual disabilities. Successful programs also offered a wide variety of placements so that individual needs and interests would be fulfilled.","This article provided insights on how to structure and implement transitional employment programs, offering a background and history of transitional employment as context before discussing lessons from the implementation of the demonstration and their implications for program design. It made skillful use of both quantitative and qualitative data. It used quantitative data to offer preliminary insights into program effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. It mainly drew on qualitative data to develop findings on program implementation and best practices for the future. The article did not discuss data collection and quality assurance methods, which prevented a thorough assessment of data reliability. However, the authors thoughtfully assessed the strengths and weaknesses of their analysis. They noted that the qualitative data were collected by different site monitors but in a uniform way across sites, which facilitated comparison across transitional employment approaches, a key process study goal. They explained to readers, however, that the process study conclusions did not have the same level of validity as impact analysis","",""

Three sites were included in the study: one in Houston, operated by the Texas Employment Commission (TEC) and Houston Community College (HCC); and two in El Paso, operated by the El Paso School for Educational Enrichment (SEE) and the Greater El Paso SER Jobs for Progress (SER/JOBS).
Participants were recruited primarily through UI claimant referrals. Eligible applicants were unemployed with little chance of returning to work; receiving or already having exhausted UI benefits; and/or facing particular challenges to reemployment, such as age or language. Each site implemented a one-year program comprising job search assistance and retraining. The programs had two tiers of services: Tier I focused on job search activities and job development and Tier II provided training for those who struggled to find employment through Tier I activities.
In the TEC/HCC Houston site, Tier I included a career module focused on strategic issues, a job search workshop, and a job club; Tier II included primarily classroom training through HCC. Some on-the-job training was also available.
The SEE El Paso site offered a job-search workshop and a job club in Tier I; classroom training—mostly basic education and general equivalency diploma courses—and on-the-job training in the form of three-week courses in typing, bookkeeping, and other clerical occupations were offered in Tier II.
The SER/JOBS El Paso site implemented only a job workshop for Tier I. Tier II consisted primarily of occupational training with some classroom training in auto repair and secretarial skills.
Treatment groups were eligible to receive demonstration services; 2,259 eligible applicants were randomly assigned to a treatment group or a control group that could receive other services available in the community but not demonstration services. Of the 2,192 participants included in the final analysis, 1,026 were at the TEC/HCC Houston site, 530 at the SEE El Paso site, and 636 at the SER/JOBS El Paso site. Data on sample characteristics came from Job Training Partnership Act applications and data on program outcomes came from UI quarterly wage records, UI weekly benefit records, and a one-year follow-up survey.
To measure impacts on UI receipt, employment, and earnings, the author compared the outcomes of members of the treatment groups with those of the control group. Impacts were reported separately by gender and site, but no impacts were reported for women at the Houston site because the sample was too small. The model included dummy variables for site and treatment group, as well as controls for baseline characteristics (race, education, age, prior occupation, week of random assignment, and, in some models, prior earnings, employment, and UI benefits).","","The study found that men in the treatment groups at all three sites combined earned $329 more in the second quarter than those in the control group; however, the impact in the other quarters and averaged over the first year was not statistically significant. They also worked an average of 0.9 weeks more than men in the control group, as of the third quarter following random assignment.
Men in the treatment groups were about 6 percentage points less likely to receive UI in the first 10 weeks after random assignment and received $143 less in UI benefits over a 30-week period than men in the control group; these differences were statistically significant.
Women in the treatment groups in the two El Paso sites experienced an average first-year earnings gain of $987 above women in the control group. They were 10 to 20 percentage points more likely to be employed in the first three quarters after random assignment than the control group, according to UI wage records. They had worked 1.5 weeks and 0.9 weeks more than women in the control group in the third and fourth quarters after random assignment, respectively.
Women in the treatment groups in the El Paso sites were less likely to receive UI benefits at 10, 20, and 30 weeks after random assignment, and received $193 less in UI benefits over a 30-week period.","Although the study originated as a randomized controlled trial, the author did not provide the gender breakdown of the original randomly assigned sample by site. Therefore, it was not possible to calculate attrition for the impact estimates in the study, which are presented separately for men and for women. Because of the study’s age, CLEAR did not attempt to ask the study author for this information. Although this means that the study was not eligible for the Clearinghouse for Labor Evaluation and Research’s highest rating, the author included sufficient statistical controls in the analysis to receive a moderate evidence rating.
In addition, the author estimated multiple related impacts in the UI benefit receipt, employment, and earnings domains. Doing so increased the probability of identifying statistically significant differences by chance. Therefore, the number of statistically significant findings in these domains might be overstated.","",""

Researchers randomly assigned 1,424 eligible claimants to a treatment group who received enhanced reemployment services and 1,667 to a control group who received standard reemployment services. The enhanced services included job placement for those who were ready for immediate employment and referrals to job training programs for those whose credentials made immediate job placement impractical. Referrals were commonly made to publicly funded training programs, such as Job Training Partnership Act, Titles II and III.","","The study found that the enhanced reemployment services reduced UI duration by 1.6 weeks, on average, in the first year.","Although this study was designed as an RCT, the probability of assignment to the treatment group fluctuated during randomization. The authors did not control for these changes in their analyses, making it ineligible to receive a high causal evidence rating.

In this demonstration, about 11,000 UI claimants were randomized into one of three treatment groups, all of which received some variation of Job Search Assistance (JSA) services, or into the control group, which could receive only existing services in the community. For all participants, the study team collected administrative data, which provided information on UI receipt, employment, and earnings. The study team also surveyed a subsample of roughly 7,500 participants about their experiences in the year following random assignment.
The study found that all three treatments reduced at least one measure of UI benefits received in the benefit year. According to the survey data, the JSA-only and JSA-plus-bonus groups had higher employment and earnings in the year following participants’ initial UI claims than control group members (no difference was found for the JSA-plus-training group). However, these impacts were not observed in the administrative data.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it is based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the interventions studied, and not to other factors.","Absence of conflict of interest: This study was conducted by staff from Mathematica Policy Research, which administers CLEAR. Therefore, the review of this study was conducted by an independent consultant trained in applying the CLEAR causal evidence guidelines.","Implemented in 10 randomly selected UI offices across New Jersey, the demonstration mandated participation in JSA services for displaced workers who were recently unemployed to foster their quick reemployment. The demonstration had three service offerings: (1) JSA only; (2) JSA plus training or relocation services; and (3) JSA plus a reemployment bonus. All three interventions shared the same JSA components: an orientation session and testing; five half-day job-search workshop sessions at local New Jersey UI offices; a one-on-one counseling and assessment session with office staff; and a requirement to maintain contact with the demonstration office, either by discussing job-search activities with office staff or using the office’s resource center to conduct job-search activities.
The JSA-only group received no services other than JSA services. In the JSA-plus-training group, staff informed participants about training and relocation services available and helped participants plan their training options. In the JSA-plus-reemployment-bonus group, participants who became reemployed quickly received a bonus equal to one-half of the person’s remaining UI entitlement at the time of the assessment if he or she found employment within two weeks; the bonus declined in value by 10 percent of the original amount per week. Participants received 60 percent of the bonus if they held the job for 4 weeks, and received all of it if they were employed for 12 weeks. Bonuses were not available to claimants who were rehired by their former employers; were employed by a relative; or were in temporary, seasonal, or part-time work.
Eligibility screening for the demonstration excluded claimants who (1) had not received their first UI payment, had their first payment more than five weeks after their initial claim, had a partial first payment, or a special type of claim (such as a claim by an ex-service member); (2) were younger than 25 years old; (3) had been on their previous job for fewer than three years; (4) had a specific date for being recalled by their former employer; and (5) were typically hired through union hiring halls.","All those eligible for the demonstration were randomly assigned to the JSA-only group (2,416 participants), JSA-plus-training group (3,810 participants), JSA plus-reemployment-bonus group (2,449 participants), or the control group (2,385 participants). Administrative UI data were collected from initial intake into the study (sometime from July 1986 to June 1987) for one year. Employment and earnings data came from two sources: (1) quarterly wage records through the first quarter of 1988 and (2) a follow-up survey. About 7,500 sample members were identified for the survey, which was fielded from January to August 1988, and included self-reported information on earnings and employment.
To measure impacts on UI receipt, employment, and earnings, the authors compared the outcomes of members of each of the three treatment groups with those of the control group.","The study found that the JSA-only, JSA-plus-training, and JSA-plus-reemployment bonus groups reduced at least one measure of UI benefits received in the benefit year relative to the control group.
According to the survey data, the JSA-only and JSA-plus-reemployment-bonus groups had higher employment rates and earnings in the year following participants’ initial UI claims than control group members (no difference was found for the JSA-plus-training group). The earnings differences were greatest in magnitude—approximately $100 to $200 per quarter—and statistically significant during the first two quarters following the initial claim, with the differences disappearing by the third quarter.
The earnings impacts were not observed when the analysis instead used administrative data.","The authors estimated multiple related impacts in the UI benefit receipt, employment, and earnings domains. Doing so increases the probability of identifying statistically significant differences by chance. Therefore, the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is probably overstated.

The authors compared UI outcomes before and after repeal using an interrupted time series design based on monthly, state-level time series data from 1971 to 1981.
The study found that the UI exhaustion rate and weeks of UI benefits received were lower when ES registration was mandatory than when it was voluntary.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is low. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to mandatory ES registration; other factors are likely to have contributed.","","","In 1971, New Jersey made registration for ES, a public program providing job search resources such as workshops and job search assistance, mandatory for all UI claimants. Four years later, in 1975, the legislature repealed the law, making ES registration voluntary for UI claimants. The idea behind the repeal was that those claimants who actually desired job search assistance would voluntarily register for ES, whereas those who did not desire the services could search on their own and certify their availability for work with the local UI office. Allowing claimants to voluntarily register for ES was hypothesized to free resources to give claimants more intensive assistance, because resources would not be used on those who were mandated to register with ES but really had no desire to receive ES.
This study investigated the impact of the policy change on UI claim duration and benefit exhaustion using monthly statewide UI claims data from 1971 to 1981. The authors compared the UI outcomes before the policy change to after the policy change while controlling for demographic characteristics of the insured unemployed; time; the business cycle; and UI policies such as mandatory registration, the wage replacement ratio, and the availability of extended benefits.","The study found that the UI claim exhaustion rate was 6 percentage points lower when ES registration was mandatory than when it was voluntary (59 versus 65 percent, respectively).
The weeks of UI benefits received were 10 percent lower under the mandatory policy.","The study used an interrupted time series design, comparing outcomes in the time period before the policy change with outcomes in the period following that change in one state. To provide high or moderate causal evidence, studies using this design must include multiple demonstrations of the impact—for instance, by introducing and withdrawing the policy at different times and/or for different units of observation. This is necessary because this method does not involve an explicit comparison group—for example, another state with similar labor market conditions that did not implement a policy change. Because the policy was implemented statewide, multiple demonstrations of the effect are not possible. Therefore, it cannot receive a high or moderate causal evidence rating. In addition, although the authors included many control variables in the analysis, we cannot be certain that the timing of the policy change was unrelated to other contextual factors that might also have resulted in the observed changes in UI benefit exhaustion and duration.","",""

Although OSHA no longer operates as it did around the time of the records-check procedure’s implementation, this study provides historical context for changes that were later made to the program.
The authors used several approaches, the strongest of which compared the percentage change in lost-workday injury rates in the years when the plant’s state had a records-check procedure and the years when the state did not have this procedure.
The study found no statistically significant differences between the percentage change in reported injury rates in plants in states with the records-check procedure and plants in states without this procedure. However, plants in risky industries in records-check states reported a statistically significant 4.7 percent reduction in injury rates.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this study is low. This means we are not confident that any changes in reported injuries within plants in records-check states or in risky industries in records-check states could be attributed to the records-check procedure.","","The study examined whether OSHA’s records-check procedure—which was introduced in 1981 in states with federal OSHA enforcement and targeted establishments for inspection based on reports of past injuries—caused manufacturing plants to underreport injuries. Plants were eligible for a records check if (1) the national injury rate for their industry was above the national average injury rate or (2) the state-level injury rate for their industry was above the national average. Selected plants were subject to a review of their injury records. If the review showed the plant had above-average injury rates, it received a complete on-site inspection.
The study analyzed the effect on injuries of (1) being in a records-check state (because some states that self-enforced OSHA did not use a records-check procedure) and (2) being in a risky industry— defined as an industry with above-average injury rates—in a records-check state (because these industries were most likely to be affected by the new procedure). The analysis used data from the 1970s and 1980s. Although OSHA no longer operates as it did during this period, this study provides historical context for changes that were later made to the program.","The authors used several approaches to estimate the effect of the records-check procedure. The strongest of these was a model with plant-level fixed effects; this model compared the percentage change in reported lost-workday injury rates in the years when the plants’ state had a records-check procedure and the years when the state did not have this procedure for (1) all plants and (2) plants in risky industries.
The authors used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Annual Survey of Occupation Injuries and Illnesses; the BLS Employment and Wages, Annual Averages series; and the Chamber of Commerce of the United States (for laws on workers’ compensation payments) for 3,059 manufacturing plants that had not received OSHA inspections between 1979 and 1985.","The study found no statistically significant differences between the percentage change in reported injury rates in plants in states with the records-check procedure and plants in states without this procedure.
Plants in risky industries in records-check states had a statistically significant 4.7 percent reduction in reported injury rates after introduction of the procedure.
Plants in less risky industries in records-check states had a statistically significant increase in reported injury rates after introduction of the procedure.","In this study, the estimated changes in injury rates within plants may reflect underlying changes in safety levels or other factors over time, rather than the effect of the records-check procedure. For example, the study found that plants in less risky industries in records-check states had a statistically significant increase in injury rates, which suggests there may be changes in injury rates over time within industries that are unrelated to the records-check procedure.

In this study, about 17,000 new UI claimants were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, both of which could participate in a reemployment bonus program, or the control group, which faced existing UI program rules and could not receive a reemployment bonus. For all participants, the study team collected administrative data on UI benefits receipt.
The study found that those in the job search incentive group had a significant reduction in UI benefits received, length of UI receipt, and proportion of claimants exhausting UI benefits, compared with the control group. Those in the hiring incentive group had a significant reduction in UI benefits received relative to the control group, but no other outcomes. 
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it is based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the reemployment bonuses, and not to other factors.","","The experiments took place in 22 Job Service Centers in northern and central Illinois in 1984 and 1985. Newly registered UI claimants ages 20 to 54 years old with 26 weeks of available UI benefits were eligible for the experiments and were randomly assigned to either the job search incentive treatment group, the hiring incentive treatment group, or a control group based on the last two digits of their Social Security numbers.
Both the job search incentive group and hiring incentive group were offered a $500 cash reemployment bonus when a claimant was reemployed within 11 weeks of filing a UI claim and kept his or her job for four months. In the job search incentive group, the bonus was given to the claimant, whereas in the hiring incentive group, the bonus was given to the claimant’s new employer. Claimants in the control group were subject to existing UI program rules, which offer weekly UI benefits but no reemployment bonus.
The authors estimated the impact of both treatments by comparing the mean outcomes of each to the outcomes of the control group. The data were drawn from UI administrative records.","","The study found that those in the job search incentive group had a statistically significant reduction of UI benefits paid in the first spell and benefit year, compared with the control group members; they received $229 less in UI benefits during the first unemployment spell and $194 less in UI benefits during the full benefit year than the control group.
The job search incentive group also received 1.15 fewer weeks of UI benefits and were 3 percentage points less likely to exhaust benefits than the control group, which was a statistically significant difference.
The study found that those in the hiring incentive group had a statistically significant reduction in UI benefits paid in the first unemployment spell of $112 compared with the control group, but there were no other statistically significant impacts on UI benefit receipt.","Many individuals offered the opportunity to participate in the experiments did not agree to participate. Of the 4,186 claimants in the job search incentive group, 3,527 agreed to participate, and of the 3,963 claimants in the hiring incentive group, 2,586 agreed to participate. The analysis included both those who agreed and those who declined to participate, which means the analyses included a considerable number of claimants who were not striving for the bonus. The job search incentive bonus was paid to only 570 claimants, and the hiring incentive bonus was paid to only 112 employers.","",""

The PDL Pilot Project attempted to encourage rapid reemployment among UI recipients recently laid off from jobs in demand through a combination of stricter job search requirements, more frequent case management, and, when necessary, mandatory job search workshops or job training. Specifically, as a condition of UI receipt, PDL participants were required to make more weekly employer contacts than would ordinarily be required (five instead of three), meet more often with case managers than would ordinarily be required (in the fifth and ninth weeks of UI receipt), and participate in job search workshops or trainings if at the ninth-week interview they were still unemployed despite making satisfactory reemployment efforts.","The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted by the New Jersey Department of Labor in Hackensack, a prosperous Northern New Jersey municipality in the mid-1980s with a local unemployment rate of less than 5 percent.

These data sources included injury data from the Department of Labor Occupational Injuries and Illnesses; unpublished OSHA data on inspections and penalties; and data on industry employment and characteristics from the Department of Labor, Employment, and Earnings and the Census Bureau.","The study found that the evidence on the effectiveness of OSHA inspections and penalties in reducing injuries was mixed, and the effects of OSHA enforcement activities on most outcomes examined varied over time.
Between 1973 and 1983, having an OSHA inspection in the previous year was associated with statistically significant reductions in injuries per employee, lost work-day injuries per employee, and lost work days per employee. During the same time period, having an OSHA inspection in the current year was associated with a statistically significant increase in injuries per employee and positive but not statistically significant increases in lost-workday injuries per employee and lost work days per employee.
Between 1973 and 1983, being assessed a penalty by OSHA in the current year or the previous year was not statistically significantly related to any of the injury outcomes.","In this study, the estimated changes within industries in injuries may reflect changes in the underlying differences in safety levels or other factors over time, rather than the impact of inspections or penalties. Years when industries have higher rates of inspections are likely less safe, on average, than those with lower rates of inspections, because some inspections are triggered by an employee complaint of a workplace hazard or by OSHA’s targeting programs. Therefore, periods in which an industry was more frequently inspected are also likely to be periods where that industry is characterized by more underlying workplace hazards. This could account for the seemingly counterintuitive finding that having an OSHA inspection was associated with an increase in injury rates.","",""

The authors randomly assigned UI claimants to four conditions, comprising three distinct treatment groups and one control group. Administrative data sources, including UI and Employment Service (ES) records as well as records of claimants’ interactions with program staff provided outcomes for sample members in all four conditions.
The study found that UI claimants in the more-intensive treatment conditions—treatment groups 1 and 2—collected UI benefits for fewer weeks than those in the control condition, by 0.76 weeks in treatment group 1 and 0.61 weeks in treatment group 2; these differences were statistically significant.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the Charleston Claimant Placement and Work Test Demonstration, and not to other factors.","","The Charleston Claimant Placement and Work Test Demonstration took place in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1983. UI claimants who received their first payment from February to December 1983, excluding job-attached claimants, were eligible for demonstration services provided through their local Job Service office. The demonstration sought to improve UI and ES coordination through additional training for staff and three potential modifications to the service delivery approach:
1. The first modification delayed Job Service registration for UI claimants until one week after the first payment was received, exempting the nearly 40 percent of eligible claimants who never received a check from registering and thus freeing Job Service resources for UI recipients. Claimants who did not register within one week were contacted and not paid until they reported to UI.
2. The second offered enhanced placement services to claimants, including a placement interview during which claimants received job referrals or job-development attempts, enhanced job referral activities, and job search trainings. Recipients of these services who were not reemployed within nine weeks were sent a second call-in notice requiring them to report to the ES for a return visit to receive further services.
3. The third modification added job search workshops for claimants who had been collecting UI benefits for four weeks. These workshops covered search and interview techniques and local labor market information.
To test the effectiveness of these program features, program officials randomly assigned eligible UI claimants to one of four conditions (three treatment and one control): Treatment group 1 members were subject to the delayed Job Service registration and offered enhanced placement services and job search workshops (for a total of up to three call-in notices). Treatment group 2 members were subject to the delayed Job Service registration and offered enhanced placement services (for a total of up to two call-in notices). Treatment group 3 members were subject to the delayed Job Service registration only (one call-in notice). The control group followed the predemonstration procedures used in South Carolina (no call-in notice and regular services) and could use ES voluntarily.
The study authors collected administrative data from regular UI and ES records, supplemented with demonstration data, to estimate the impacts of the three treatments, relative to the control condition.","","The study found that UI claimants in the more-intensive treatment groups, treatment groups 1 and 2, collected benefits for fewer weeks than those in the control group, by 0.76 weeks in treatment group 1 and 0.61 weeks in treatment group 2. These differences were statistically significant.
In addition, members of treatment groups 1 and 2 were 3 to 4 percent more likely to obtain a long-term job placement than those in the control group, and these differences were statistically significant.","In 1983, as the demonstration was underway, Charleston’s unemployment rate fell by more than 2 percentage points and overall employment rose significantly. As a result, the authors cautioned that the study’s results might also be attributable to the improving labor market. In addition, the results might not be generalizable to other cities or states, because the demonstration activities were part of ongoing administrative system changes in Charleston.","",""

The STETS program included a suite of work-readiness training, transitional jobs, and postplacement support services for young adults with intellectual disabilities.
The study was a randomized controlled trial that randomly assigned young adults to the treatment group, which could participate in the STETS program, or to the control group, which could not. The study drew on data from in-person interviews conducted 6, 15, and 22 months after the start of the program.
The study found that young adults in the treatment group were employed at significantly higher rates and, on average, earned more than the control group 15 and 22 months after the program began. The study also found that 15 months after random assignment, the young adults in the treatment group were significantly less likely than those in the control group to receive SSI or SSDI benefits.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it is based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial. This means we are confident that the estimated effects are attributable to the STETS program, and not to other factors.","","The Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation developed and administered the Structured Training and Employment Transitional Services program in 1981 and 1982. The STETS program provided training, transitional jobs, and continuing support services to young adults with intellectual disabilities. Participants received training and support services in a low-stress environment to develop basic work habits, skills, and attitudes. Participants were offered transitional jobs, which provided on-the-job training in local firms and agencies. The training and transitional jobs portion of the program lasted up to 15 months. Participants also received up to 6 months of support services after securing regular employment. On average, program participants enrolled in the STETS program for nearly 11 months, including 370 hours in training and 340 hours in transitional jobs. To be eligible for STETS, participants had to be ages 18 to 24 with limited work experience, an intelligence quotient (IQ) between 40 and 80, and no work-disabling secondary handicap.","The authors used a randomized controlled trial to estimate the effects of the STETS program. Of eligible applicants to the program, 437 people were randomly assigned either to the treatment group, which could participate in the STETS program, or the control group, which could not participate in the STETS program but could access other programs in the community. The study drew on data from in-person interviews with study participants conducted 6, 15, and 22 months after the start of the program. The 15-month follow-up measured outcomes after the completion of the training and transitional jobs portion of the intervention, and the 22-month follow-up measured outcomes following the completion of the full program. When interviews with study participants left missing or inconsistent data on critical items, the authors completed interviews with proxy respondents such as a parent, relative, or caseworker. The authors estimated regression models comparing the outcomes of treatment and control group members, taking into account the study site, IQ, age, gender, race and ethnicity, living arrangement, financial management skills, receipt of transfers, secondary handicaps, cause of disability, benefactor, work experience in previous two years, and school status of each individual.","The study found that, compared with the control group, the treatment group was 9.4 percentage points more likely to be employed 15 months after the program began, and 11.9 percentage points more likely to be employed 22 months after the program began.
Compared with the control group, the treatment group earned significantly more: on average, the treatment group earned $10.59 more per week 15 months after the program began and $15.81 more per week more 22 months after the program began.
The study found no significant differences in earnings or employment between the treatment and control groups six months after the program began.
Compared with the control group, STETS participants were 7.6 percentage points less likely to receive SSI or SSDI 15 months after the program began. However, the study found no significant differences in SSI or SSDI receipt between the treatment and control groups 6 or 22 months after the start of the program. In addition, the study found no significant differences in the average monthly SSI or SSDI income received by the two groups 6, 15, or 22 months after STETS began.","The study authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to long-term earnings, employment, and benefit receipt. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated.","Cincinnati, Ohio

The study used a structural model to examine differences in the injury rates and noncompliance for industries that received higher rates of OSHA inspections.
The study did not find a statistically significant relationship between noncompliance with OSHA standards and workplace injuries.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this study is low. This means we are not confident that the differences in injury rates among industries with higher rates of noncompliance are attributable solely to noncompliance or that differences in noncompliance rates among industries with higher rates of inspections are attributable to inspections.","","The study examined the effect of OSHA inspections on noncompliance with OSHA standards and the effect of noncompliance on lost-workday injuries. Noncompliance was measured by penalties per inspection per worker. The study attempted to distinguish between two competing hypotheses to explain why previous studies had failed to find any discernible impacts of OSHA activities on injury rates: (1) the noncompliance hypothesis, which proposed that OSHA cannot compel firms to comply with its standards because of limited statutory and budgetary authority from Congress; and (2) the inefficiency hypothesis, which proposed that OSHA does not affect accidents because it regulates only capital, and accidents are caused by complex interactions in the workplace environment.

Although OSHA no longer operates as it did during this period, this study provides historical context for later changes made to the program.","The study did not find a statistically significant relationship between noncompliance and workplace injuries.

The instrumental variables used in the study do not satisfy this condition. For example, the authors used workers’ education as an instrument for injuries when estimating the impact of injuries on noncompliance, but workers’ education could directly affect noncompliance if better-educated workers were better able to implement safety standards. Similarly, the authors used indicators for the type of industry (for example, primary metals or paper mills) as instruments for noncompliance in regressions predicting inspections, but industry type could affect whether firms are inspected (because high-injury industries are targeted) and whether workers are injured (because some industries are inherently more dangerous than others). Because of the direct linkages between the instruments and the outcome variables, the instrumental variables approach in this study does not provide causal estimates.","",""

The author used a regression model to compare the differences in injury rates of manufacturing and construction firms that received inspections in March and April (“early”) with those that received inspections in November and December (“late”).
The study found that, relative to late OSHA inspections, early OSHA inspections were not associated with a statistically significantly reduction in injury rates within the year of inspection.
The quality of causal evidence for some analyses presented in this study is moderate because the analyses used a well-conducted nonexperimental design. This means we have confidence that these findings provide some evidence that OSHA inspections had no effect on injury rates.","","The study examined the effect of OSHA inspections that occurred early in the year (March and April), relative to the effect of those that occurred late in the year (November and December), on injury rates in manufacturing and construction firms between 1976 and 1978. Although OSHA no longer operates as it did during this period, this study provides historical context for changes that were later made to the program.","The study used a regression model to compare the difference in injury rates of firms that received inspections in March and April and those that received inspections in November and December. If inspections reduce injury rates, then firms inspected in the spring might have lower injury rates during the year compared to firms inspected in the fall. The model controlled for differences between the types of establishments that received inspections at different times of the year by including controls for injury rates in the prior year, employment, firm size, and industry. Regressions were estimated separately for each year of data.
The authors used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Annual Survey of Occupational Illnesses and Injuries for 1,990 firms in 1976; 1,846 firms in 1977; and 1,801 firms in 1978.","Relative to late OSHA inspections, early OSHA inspections were not associated with a statistically significant reduction in injury rates within the year of inspection.","The author’s estimation strategy required that firms inspected early and late in the year (and inspections occurring early and late in the year) were not systematically different, after controlling for the other variables used in the regression. This assumption was likely reasonable for inspections conducted in 1976 and 1977. However, in 1978 OSHA developed a new system for determining which firms to inspect in response to the Supreme Court’s ruling on Marshall v. Barlow’s Inc. As a result of the ruling, OSHA created a system for prioritizing inspections so that the ones more likely to be unsafe were inspected earlier in the year. This suggests that before 1978, firms inspected early and late in the year were likely not systematically different, while in 1978 and later years, we cannot be confident that firms inspected early and late in the year are comparable.
Even in the cases for which the comparisons were valid, the period of time over which effects in this study were estimated might not be long enough to detect differences in annual injury rates. Firms inspected in the spring would have had to make changes to reduce injury rates immediately following the inspection in order for their average injury rates in the inspection year to decline.","",""

Although OSHA no longer operates as it did during the study period, the study provides historical context for the program.
Method 1 used a regression model to compare injuries across three firms from 1973 to 1980. Method 2 used a different regression model to compare changes in work days lost because of injuries from 1975 to 1976 to changes in OSHA inspections during the same period, using data at the industry-by-state level.
The study found that firms had 35.8 fewer injuries in the years in which they received a citation; however, citations in past years were not significantly related to current year injuries.

It examined the effect of receiving an OSHA citation in the beginning of the current year, the previous year, and the year before that. The outcome variable of interest was the total number of injuries in a given year. Method 2 examined the effect of changes in the number of OSHA inspections conducted in 1975 and 1976, aggregating data to the industry-state level. The outcome variable of interest was the change in annual lost work days due to injury from 1975 to 1976. Although OSHA no longer operates as it did during the study period, the study provides historical context for the program.","For their first method, the authors used a regression model to consider the effect of OSHA citations on injury rates. The key explanatory variables were a set of indicators for receiving a citation in the current year, one year ago, and two years ago. The regression controlled for expected injuries and real maximum Workers’ Compensation benefits measured at the state level. The data for the analysis were derived from the personnel files of the three firms and injury logs submitted by the firms to the Bureau of Labor Statistics from 1973 to 1980.
For their second method, the authors used a regression model to consider the effect of changes in OSHA inspections in a given industry and state on changes in lost workdays in that industry and state. Regressions controlled for the industry-state level changes in the maximum Workers’ Compensation payment, the number of establishments in operation, the number of hours per worker, and the number of production workers. The analysis used injury data from OSHA’s Office of Management Data Systems and inspection data, also from OSHA, by industry and state for 20 states and two-digit manufacturing industries with 5,000 or more production workers (a total of 167 industry-state observations). Data on industry characteristics by state were obtained from the Annual Survey of Manufacturers.","Using method 1, the study found that firms had 35.8 fewer injuries in the years in which they received a citation; however, citations in past years were not significantly related to current year injuries.
Using method 2, the study found that one additional OHSA inspection resulted in a 2.8 day reduction in the number of days lost because of injuries within a state and industry categorization.","For method 1 of this study, the estimated differences in injuries could reflect underlying differences in safety levels or other factors between the plants being compared, and not the effect of receiving a citation. For example, suppose a plant had a large number of hazards and was working to improve its conditions. If the plant were inspected while these hazards were still being cleared, it would receive a citation. After the inspection, the plant’s number of injuries would decrease; however, the change would be due to the hazard abatement activities the firm began to conduct before the inspection and citation. Thus, we could not attribute the change in injuries to the inspection itself.
For method 2 of this study, a decrease in injury rates for industry-state observations receiving increased inspections may be caused by underlying differences between the industry-states being compared and not the inspections themselves. The study did not control for underlying factors at the state level or over time that might influence both inspection activity and injury rates.","",""

Therefore, the firms that receive inspections likely have more underlying workplace hazards, on average, than firms that are not inspected. Similarly, firms that received a penalty likely have more egregious safety violations than those that were inspected and did not receive a penalty. In the absense of inspections, firms with more hazards and safety violations may have experienced different changes in injury rates as conditions deteriorated or because management would have made improvements to address unsafe working conditions.","",""

Relative to existing services, NCPP case management offered better coordination between UI and employment service workers and gave caseworkers more flexibility to assist claimants with job search.","The study was conducted in Reno, North Las Vegas, and Las Vegas. Across the four sites, 3,545 participants were randomly assigned—2,371 in the treatment group and 1,174 in the control group. The primary data source was UI administrative records of benefit receipt. The author estimated the program’s impacts by comparing UI benefit receipt of treatment and control group members. The author also estimated impacts in a similar way for the subgroup of non-union claimants.","The study found that treatment group members received $318 less in UI benefit payments than control group members.
For the subgroup of non-union claimants, the study found a $296 reduction in the average amount of UI benefits received and a 3.9-week reduction in the average weeks of UI benefits received.","The author estimated program impacts as simple research group differences and did not perform tests of statistical significance, which would provide a basis for confidence in the results; without the results of these statistical tests, it is not possible to determine whether the estimated impacts reflect true differences between the groups.
Although the research design was a randomized controlled trial, analysis sample sizes were not presented; because the study was published more than 20 years ago, CLEAR did not conduct an author query to gather this information. Because attrition could not be determined, the study is ineligible for a high evidence rating, and because the author did not include statistical controls for UI claimant characteristics when estimating impacts, it is ineligible for a moderate evidence rating.","",""

Evaluation Review, 23(2), 162–189","","https://clear.dol.gov/study/evaluating-vocational-rehabilitation-program-using-longitudinal-data-evidence-quasi","","","Moderate Causal Evidence","Topic Area: Disability Employment Policy","Causal Impact Analysis","Quasi-Experimental Design (QED)","Evaluating the Vocational Rehabilitation Program using longitudinal data: Evidence for a quasi-experimental research design","The study’s objective was to determine the impact of participation in Vocational Rehabilitation (VR), a state and federal program, on earnings for people with disabilities. VR provides services and supports to people with disabilities to help them achieve their employment goals.
The authors analyzed linked Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) and Social Security Administration (SSA) data for about 29,000 people whose VR cases were closed in 1980. The linked data contained annual earnings histories, service expenditures, and disability and demographic information.
By the eighth year after first receiving VR services, women in six of seven disability categories and men in four of seven disability categories earned significantly more than their counterparts who had not received VR services.
The quality of the causal evidence presented in this study is moderate. This means we have some confidence that the observed effects represent the impact of VR, although other factors might also have contributed.","","The VR program, which is administered jointly by states and the federal government, provides services and supports to transition-age youth and working-age adults with disabilities to help them achieve their employment goals. These services and supports can include counseling, job training or placement, formal education, income support, and physical or mental health services. VR counselors provide guidance and job placement services but typically refer recipients to private organizations, such as educational institutions or health care companies, for other services.","The authors analyzed data from the 1980 RSA-SSA DataLink, which contained annual earnings histories, service expenditures, disability type, and demographic information for a random 10 percent sample of VR clients whose cases were closed in 1980—a total of 28,986 observations. Members of the treatment group had received VR services, whereas those in the comparison group had applied and qualified for VR but never received VR services.
To estimate the impact of receiving VR services on earnings, the authors compared the differences in earnings of treatment and comparison group members from two years before to each of the first eight years after being found eligible for VR. The authors estimated VR impacts separately for women and men in each of seven disability categories: visual impairments, hearing and speech impairments, musculoskeletal conditions, internal conditions, mental illness, substance abuse, and intellectual disabilities.","The study found that receiving VR services led to increased earnings for women in almost all disability categories in most post-program years.
Among women, earnings gains in the short term were largest for those with mental illnesses—a gain of $1,450 per year more than comparison group members in the first post-program year—but this declined in magnitude over subsequent years. Women with visual impairments had increasing earnings gains over the period examined, from $1,090 in the first post-program year to $2,185 in the eighth post-program year (all in 1980 dollars).
For men, receiving VR services led to increased earnings in some years in all disability categories except hearing and speech impairments. Men with musculoskeletal and internal disabilities saw consistent earnings gains relative to comparison group counterparts, in all post-program years, up to $1,870 (musculoskeletal) and $1,955 (internal) by the eighth post-program year. Men with substance abuse problems and intellectual disabilities realized gains in the first one to three post-program years, but these impacts faded thereafter.","The study was a carefully executed fixed-effects design and therefore receives a moderate causal evidence rating, the highest available to nonexperimental designs. However, because the data did not contain information on changes in functional limitations over time, the results could be biased if people who received VR services experienced more changes in functioning over time than comparison group members did.
In addition, the study excluded all people whose earnings were truncated because they exceeded the maximum of the Federal Insurance Contribution Act tax base (about 2.7 percent of cases). This could artificially shrink the observed impacts because these participants’ earnings were high relative to the rest of the sample.","",""

Cambridge, MA: NBER.","","https://clear.dol.gov/study/investor-behavior-and-purchase-company-stock-401k-plans%E2%80%94-importance-plan-design-liang","","","Low Causal Evidence","Topic Area: Behavioral Finance: Retirement","Causal Impact Analysis","Regression Analysis","Investor behavior and the purchase of company stock in 401(k) plans—the importance of plan design","The study’s objective was to determine whether 401(k) plan characteristics, including the number of total investment options offered by a 401(k) plan and the requirements for whether employers’ matching contributions had to be allocated to employer stock, influenced the percentage of employees’ 401(k) plan contributions allocated to employer stock.
The authors analyzed differences in portfolio allocations based on the number of funds available and other key plan characteristics using data from Compustat and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) forms and regression analyses, controlling for firm-fixed effects.
The number of investment options and the percentage of assets allocated to employer stock were negatively correlated. Further, employees at firms that required employer matching contributions to be allocated to employer stock allocated a larger share of assets to employer stock than those at other firms.
The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is low. This low rating means that we are not confident that differences among plan characteristics caused changes in the share of funds allocated to employer stock. Other factors are likely to have contributed.","","","","The study found that the number of investment offerings was negatively associated with the percentage of assets allocated to employer stock.
Employees in firms that required employer matching contributions to be allocated to employer stock allocated a larger share of assets to employer stock than did employees of companies without such a requirement. This suggests employees did not offset the employer match in employer stock by reducing their own contributions to employer stock.
The presence of a limit on the share of funds allocated to employer stock was negatively associated with the percentage of investment in employer stock, whereas imposing a minimum was positively associated with employer stock allocations.","By controlling for firm-fixed effects and other variables, the authors accounted for important employee and firm characteristics. However, these controls did not account for many time-varying factors that might relate to both 401(k) characteristics and employees’ investment choices. For example, employees’ investment preferences can change over time, driving changes in fund structure. If such changes in preferences occurred, increases in demand for investment options or other plan provisions might lead to increases in both the number of funds offered and share of all investments in employer stock, creating the correlation observed in the data.
Further, changes in firm composition can be correlated with changes in 401(k) plan characteristics. Because this study used data at the firm level, it must demonstrate the composition of employees within firms remained constant over time. No evidence is provided on changes in the composition of firms or investors.","",""
